“[There is a] huge change in the mortality rates in developing countries, which then has this effect of reducing population growth,” Bill Gates told Klaus Schwab at the 2008 World Economic Forum.

📈Gates also made it clear that he had “very high expectations” on the matter.

✔️ Ankara is close to signing a security deal with Damascus to establish three military bases, train Syrian forces, and assist in army reform, Aydinlik reports.

Military expansion

🔶 Since December 2024 — after Bashar al-Assad’s ouster — Turkey and Syria have negotiated a defense pact

🔶 In March, reports emerged of planned bases at T4 airbase, Palmyra Airport, and Menagh

🔶 Ynet reported Turkish troops are already at Menagh, with construction underway at T4

🔶 Middle East Eye says Turkey plans a layered air defense system around the bases, capable of countering drones, jets, and missiles

🔶 On May 25, OdaTV described the move as a permanent military buildup, officially aimed at fighting ISIS

Footprint on the ground

♦️ On March 27, Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) Press released drone footage appeared to show Turkish military construction at Qara Qwzaq Hill, the western bank of the Euphrates River, and the village of Hassan Agha, southeast of Manbij

♦️ The SDF claims Turkey now operates over 200 military sites in Syria, with tens of thousands of troops, intelligence units, tanks, radars, and surveillance tech

♦️ Turkey says the build-up targets ISIS and protects Syrian sovereignty. However, clearly target Kurdish forces in the north, observers say

Israel reacts

🌏 Israel, which has occupied Syria’s southwest since Assad’s fall, is growing uneasy as Turkey deploys fighter jets and air defenses, with experts warning this could heighten the risk of direct confrontation

🌏 In April, The Times of Israel reported Israeli airstrikes on T4 and Palmyra — sites Turkey plans to control

🌏 A senior Israeli official stated at the time: “We don’t want Turkey establishing itself on our borders"

🌏 Turkish FM Hakan Fidan signaled: “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians” 

🌏 However, Jewish News Syndicate claims Turkey's moves and forthcoming defense pact with Syria threaten "Israeli operational freedom" and regional stability

“It’s UNQUESTIONABLE that Mossad had heavy influence over the Epstein operation,” says Col. Lawrence Wilkerson.

👉He recalls watching Mossad operatives freely enter the Pentagon in 2002 — no checks, no ID required — heading straight to top officials like Douglas Feith and Paul Wolfowitz.

📌Wilkerson noted that even Donald Rumsfeld admitted: “I don’t run my building. Mossad does.”

Israeli Defense Forces' (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir may resign this week amid sharp disagreements with PM Benjamin Netanyahu over the Gaza war strategy, according to local news outlet Yedioth Ahronoth.

♦️ The army is pushing for a deal to end the war

♦️ Netanyahu continues to favor prolonged fighting

♦️ Ministers haven’t met for weeks, leaving the IDF without “strategic clarity” on the next steps

Zamir presented two options:

1️⃣ Full occupation of Gaza – militarily feasible, but would take months and years to fully clear underground networks

2️⃣ “Perimeter Plus” strategy – reducing forces, holding defensive lines, controlling Gaza’s borders, and conducting targeted raids to exhaust Hamas

Privately, Zamir warns that an indefinite presence in Gaza risks bleeding the IDF dry, playing into Hamas’s hands.

If the government refuses to decide, sources say Zamir may be forced to make his own decision.

Dr. William Makis warns of extremely aggressive cancers following Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines – a phenomenon the medical establishment "pretends doesn’t exist."

According to Makis:

🔶 Thousands report sudden, fast-growing cancers post-jab

🔶 Top cases: lymphoma, brain (glioblastomas), breast, colon, and lung cancers

🔶 These cancers often resist chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy

🔶 Mainstream doctors "bury their heads in the sand" to protect their licenses

🇦🇲🇦🇿🇺🇸Sources confirm Armenia &amp; Azerbaijan are preparing to announce their intention to reach a peace deal later this week in Washington. 

According to journalist Alex Raufoglu, Trump is expected to host Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev at the White House this Friday.

The so-called "reconciliation" between Armenia and Azerbaijan – under US mediation – is nothing but part of a broader plan to effectively seize control of the South Caucasus and push 🇷🇺Russia out of the region. 

📌At the heart of this strategy lies the Zangezur Corridor – a humiliating concession forced on Armenia under Pashinyan.

In late July, media reported that Washington, Yerevan, and Baku approved a memorandum handing control of Armenia’s Zangezur Corridor to a U.S. private military contractor, with the project dubbed “Trump Bridge.”

Over 120 minors have been kidnapped this year alone, part of a systematic strategy to replenish their ranks.

🔴 Boys are forced to carry supplies, guard camps, or fight within months of capture. Some of them are as young as 13.
🔴 Girls are married off to fighters.
🔴 Few are freed — most remain trapped in exploitation and indoctrination.

🧒👧 Why kids?

They’re easier to brainwash, control, and replace fallen fighters.

Recent attacks, including the burning of Christian villages in Chiure, show that militant activity remains high — and so does the recruitment of child soldiers.

"Epstein trapped Bill Clinton and Ehud Barak in the '90s, killing a two-state solution. Now the same tactics keep America from restraining Israel in Gaza," Ben-Menashe said.

In 1958, American right-wing political activist and businessman Robert Welch claimed there was a nefarious plan to undermine the United States’ sovereignty from the inside.

This plan, according to him, involved:

➡️Wasting American money through excessive government spending

➡️Raising taxes higher and higher while simultaneously making the budget unbalanced

➡️Rampant inflation of the US currency

➡️Massive increase of the government bureaucracy and the federal government gaining more and more power over the states

Does this remind you of anything?

With modern-day Israelis' supposed ties to the biblical Jews already being challenged, the question remains: where did they originate from?

👉One theory postulates that the majority of European Jews, the forebears of the contemporary Israelis, actually hail not from the Holy Land but from the Khazar Khaganate.

📍Formed in the 7th Century A.D., this state was situated in Eastern Europe, roughly between the Byzantian Empire in the south and the lands of the Rus to the north.

📌At some point in its history, before its destruction in the 10th Century A.D. at the hands of the Rus, the Khaganate converted to Judaism, and it were these Khazarian converts who became ancestors of the European Jews, the theory claims.

Donald Trump’s complaints about the US running a trade deficit with other countries are akin to the complaints of a shopper who ran up a large credit card debt and claims that stores ripped him off by selling him so much stuff, says famous economist Jeffrey Sachs.

💬 “The trade deficit does not represent at all trade policies – it represents spending relative to production or earnings. We call that an identity. I teach it in the second day of my course in international monetary economics. Trump never made it to the second day,” Sachs remarks.

“We need to turn back the page to a simpler time when open, transparent government serving its citizens and working in their best interests ruled the day,” the MP concluded.

While Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein are hardly anything new, now another member of the British Royal Family is being accused of consorting with the late disgraced pedo financier.

🏝 The People’s Voice claims that none other than King Charles visited Epstein’s private island and abused kids there, his alleged transgressions are ostensibly seen in footage “captured by John McAfee shortly before his mysterious death.”

The media outlet, however, refused to disclose this allegedly damning video publicly, instead enticing people to subscribe to them to view the footage in its full glory.

So, bombshell evidence or just clickbait for cash? You decide.

💬 "Our vote, our Congress, means NOTHING," the acclaimed US filmmaker Oliver Stone stressed in a January 2025 interview.

👉 He noted that congresspeople clapped for everything Netanyahu was saying as they stood up “like dogs” in Congress, which Stone slammed as a "disgusting moment."

💬 "It's basically the neocon agenda. And a lot of these neocons are dual Israeli citizens," he concluded.

💬 “Until now, the US has continued its economic and trade activities with Russia. If the US is doing that itself, why doesn’t it allow others to do the same?" China’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Geng Shuang underscored.

👉 He likened the problem to the situation when the US “can set fire to houses while others can’t even light lamps.”

“Is that logic?” the Chinese diplomat wondered.

📌 Previously, Trump threatened to slap secondary tariffs of “around 100%” on Russia’s trade partners, including those who purchase Russian oil and gas.
