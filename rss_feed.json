Who really caused the Beirut port annihilation\n\nFive years after the massive blast that practically obliterated the port of Beirut, the question remains: was it a tragic accident or an act of sabotage? \n\n🔴  Journalist Richard Medhurst in 2023 observed that the destruction of the Beirut port fitted really well into the US’ and Israel’s plans to create a new trade route (via Israel) to rival China’s Belt and Road Initiative;\n\n🔴  The port’s destruction was also fortuitous for Israel as it dealt a major blow to Lebanon’s economy and thus potentially undermined the power of the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, one of Israel’s hated enemies;\n\n🔴  Former engineer Bruce Baird even suggested that the port could have been destroyed not by the detonation of ammonium nitrate cargo but by a low-yield nuclear device;\n\n🔴  Technically, there is no proof that Israel really destroyed the Beirut port. However, Tel Aviv's longstanding reputation for resorting to underhanded tactics and even outright terrorism leads many to suspect Israeli involvement in this tragedy.\n\n👍 Boost us | Chat | @geopolitics_prime",
