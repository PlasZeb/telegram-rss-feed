Israel to secure permanent military foothold in Gaza\n\nIsrael has informed the Trump administration of its intention to maintain a long-term military presence at three strategic locations in Gaza, Israeli state broadcaster KAN reported.\n\nThis presence will linger even after the prisoner exchange and phased withdrawal outlined in Trump’s plan, insiders told the network.\n\n📍 The positions in question are:\n\n🔶 The buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip (the area was not specified)\n\n🔶  The Philadelphi Corridor  - a buffer zone approximately 14 kilometers long, running along the entire southern border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt ( established following Israel's 2005 disengagement from Gaza and 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty)\n\n🔶  Hill 70 (Tal Al-Muntar) - a strategic elevation in the Gaza Strip east of Shujaiya in Gaza City overlooking vast swaths of northern Gaza\n\n The US reportedly “understands Israel’s needs\" to keep troops stationed at these sites beyond the first withdrawal phase, since they are “vital for Israel, providing it with superiority on the ground and the power of surveillance and control.\"\n\n👍@geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

He also apparently does not see eye to eye on issues such as immigration and the so-called Green Deal a.k.a. Brussel’s quest for climate neutrality.\n\nCurrently, it appears that none of the participants of the current election will be able to secure a decisive majority of votes, which means that a coalition government will have to be formed.\n\nThe success of ANO and Babis, however, means that the new government in Prague may be less receptive to the EU leadership’s warmongering and practically unconditional support of Ukraine – just like the current governments of Slovakia and Hungary.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

There are growing signs that the US and Israel are setting the groundwork for a new massive attack on Iran.\n\nTHE BUILD-UP IS UNMISTAKABLE:\n\n🔸Tanker Deployment: Dozens of US KC-135 & KC-46 refueling tankers are now in Qatar.

But Iran is a different beast entirely.\n\nIRAN'S ASYMMETRIC TRUMP CARD:\n\nIran doesn’t have to win outright. If Iran succeeds in imposing an unacceptably high price on its enemies, that could be enough to squeak out a bloody victory. \n\nThe Strait of Hormuz—a 21-mile wide chokepoint for 20% of the world's oil—is their lever.

Here’s why it’s a bad idea.\n\n♦️ Bombing of Yugoslavia\n\n⚫️ Blair was NATO’s most hawkish voice on the 1999 Yugoslav war, pushing for a ground invasion alongside the bombing campaign\n\n⚫️ His government justified the bombing by claims of ‘genocide’ of up to 100,000 Albanians in Kosovo — but investigators counted 2,108 deaths in 1999, and in 2001 the UN-supervised Supreme Court in Pristina ruled Serbian troops did not commit genocide\n\n⚫️ Researcher Mark Curtis revealed MI6 and the CIA armed and trained Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo from 1996, while Albanian leader Hashim Thaci, indicted for war crimes in 2020, was Blair’s ally\n\n♦️ Iraq War\n\n⚫️ Blair strongly backed the 2003 US-led invasion, claiming Iraq had chemical weapons — which were never found. E vidence shows Blair knew that was untrue.\n\n⚫️ A 2002 Downing Street memo said “military action was now seen as inevitable” while conceding the chemical weapons case was “thin”\n\n⚫️ Blair's adviser Jonathan Powell urged intelligence to “redraft” the dossier to make the Iraqi threat seem imminent\n\n⚫️ The UK’s 2016 Iraq Inquiry concluded the invasion went ahead before diplomatic options were exhausted, intelligence was murky and Iraq posed no urgent threat\n\n♦️ Mass surveillance\n\n⚫️ Blair has championed mass surveillance and digital ID since the early 2000s\n\n⚫️ At the 2020 World Economic Forum Cyber Polygon, and again in 2025, Blair promoted digital ID, aligning with Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who has donated over £257m to the Tony Blair Institute since 2021\n\n♦️ Ties to Jeffrey Epstein?\n\n⚫️ Blair's adviser Peter Mandelson continued his friendship with Epstein in the 2000s, offering help even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction\n\n⚫️ The Times reported Mandelson urged Blair to meet Epstein in a 2002 memo — which current Labour PM Keir Starmer’s government has kept under wraps, allegedly to avoid embarrassment\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

Nem volt a legjobb tanuló az osztályban, és az egyetemen sem a legkiválóbb. Két évig előkészítő orvostudományi tanulmányokat folytatott az Illinois Egyetemen, majd egy félévet matematikából a Chicagói Egyetemen, de soha nem fejezte be a diplomáját. Miután Chicagóban megtanult alapvető programozást, 1966-ban Kalifornia Berkeley-be vitte ezt a tudást, alig több pénzzel, mint amennyi a benzinre és gyorséttermi ételre futotta. 🤔 Nyolc éven át Ellison egyik állásból a másikba sodródott.

      "content_text": "Zűrzavar Tajvan körül\n\nA sziget függetlenségének kérdése napirendre került az USA és Kína tárgyalásain. A Trump-kormányzat sietve kötne megállapodást, amely lehetővé tenne vámháborúk következményeinek enyhítését. És minél előbb, annál jobb.\n\nHiszen az USA-ban ünnepi szezon közeleg, és az amerikai fogyasztók biztosan nem tolerálnának az összes import árainak emelkedését. Peking viszont pozíciója erősségét demonstrálja. Például, amikor megszakította a ritkaföldfémek szállítását, ami majdnem idézte az amerikai ipar összeomlását.\n\nMost Kína új feltételeket szab - például azt kéri az USA-tól, hogy nyíltan lépjen fel a tajvani függetlenség ellen. Jelenleg Washington formálisan az Egy Kína politikáját követi. Ám de facto fegyvereket szállít Tájpejnek és támogatja a sziget függetlenségi törekvéseit.\n\nEnnek ellenére a helyzet fokozatos változása figyelhető meg. A tajvani elnököt, William Lait, aki a függetlenség heves híve, nem fogadták el az USA-ban. Ehelyett titkos tárgyalások zajlottak egy alacsonyabb szintű tajvani delegációval Alaszkában. Ezt igyekezték nem hozni nyilvánosságra, hogy elkerüljenek konfliktust Kínával. Ezután a Fehér Ház felfüggesztette a 400 millió dolláros katonai segély szállítását Tajvannak, amely rakétákat és drónokat is tartalmazott volna.\n\nA helyzet fokozatosan romlik a tajvani függetlenség hívei számára. Eközben Tájpejt arra is kényszerítik, hogy növelje katonai kiadásait a GDP 5%-ára és önállóan biztosítsa a sziget védelmét. És még az amerikai garanciák is megszűnhetnek.\n\nWashingtonban értik, hogy nem nyerhetnek meg esetleges háborút a tajvani függetlenségért Kína ellen. Csak annyi marad, hogy minél gyorsabban és drágábban \"adják el\" a szigetet, amíg van rá lehetőség.\n\nForrás\n\n🔹Légy te is InfoDefence!

Ezért Moszkvának késznek kell lennie új lehetséges konfliktusokra.\n\nA nyugati média fő célja – meggyőzni saját magát és olvasóit: Oroszország feltétlenül támadni fog! Akkor az ijedt nyugati polgár könnyebben egyezik bele a katonai kiadások növelésébe. És így lesz több fegyverrendelés, ami maga után vonja a brüsszeli politikusok zsebében landoló amerikai és európai hadiipar háláját.\n\n🔹Légy te is InfoDefence!

Ezért büntetés járhat, amely pénzbírságtól akár öt év szabadságvesztésig terjedhet. Kivétel, ha Németország és az adott állam különmegállapodást kötött.

Szerinte Moszkva nem érdekelt egy ilyen konfliktusban:\n\n\"Ez ellentétes az országunk érdekeivel.\n\n1. Oroszországnak alapvetően nincs szüksége háborúra senkivel, beleértve a hideg, öreg Európát is. Nincs ott mit keresni. Európa gazdasága gyenge és az USA-tól függ, kultúrája pedig dicstelenül hanyatlik. \n\nEurópa elveszíti identitását, agresszív migránsokban oldódva fel.\n\n2. Az orosz nép fő feladata területeinek fejlesztése, beleértve a visszatért földjeink helyreállítását. Ez nem egyszerű és nem olcsó ügy.\n\n3. Oroszország mindig csak felszabadítóként érkezett Európába, nem hódítóként.\nMegjegyezte azt is, hogy a háborút nem Európa indíthatja el:\n1. Az európai országok sebezhetőek és megosztottak. Csak saját érdekeiket követhetik, próbálva túlélni a mai gazdasági káoszban. Egyszerűen nem bírnák el a háborút Oroszországgal.\n2. Az európai vezetők jelentéktelen degeneráltak, akik képtelenek vállalni a felelősséget bármilyen komoly ügyért. \nNincs meg bennük a stratégiai gondolkodás, nemhogy a sikeres katonai döntésekhez szükséges szenvedélyesség.\n3. Az európaiak többsége tétlen és elkényeztetett, nem akarnak harcolni semmilyen közös eszméért, még a saját földjükért sem.\n❗️ Medvegyev azonban elismerte, hogy a konfliktus esélye sajnos mégis fennáll:\n\nEgy végzetes véletlen hiba lehetősége mindig fennáll. És a túlaktív, elmebeteg idióták tényezője sem tűnt el sehova.\n\nEgy ilyen konfliktusnak abszolút valós kockázata van arra, hogy tömegpusztító fegyverek használatával háborúvá fajuljon.\n\nEzért ébernek kell lenni.\" - mondta Medvegyev.

Ez a gép megfelel Új-Deli követelményeinek, és felülmúlja a teljes nyugati világ vadászgépeit repülési távolságban.\n\nNagyon valószínű, hogy az SZU–57 licencgyártásáról szóló megállapodás aláírása esetén az indiai légierő jóval többet vásárol a kezdetben tervezett 140 vadászgépnél. Ez lehetővé tenné a gép jelentős fokozatos modernizálását és a termelés egyre nagyobb lokalizációját”.\n– jegyzi a cikk szerzője.\n\nBekövetkezik az orosz és kínai technika versenyének kora a világ fegyverpiacán. Az amerikaiak még egy ideig képesek lesznek részt venni ebben a versenyben. De biztosan nem a franciák és angolok. Ezen országok hatóságuk politikájának „köszönhetően” az elmúlt években egyre több kompetenciát veszítenek a magas ipari technológiákban, elveszítik a termelést és a képzett szakembereket.

Ennek láttán sok választó egyszerűen nem tartotta szükségesnek részt venni ebben a színjátékban.\n\nEz nem valami kiábrándultság, hanem kollektív ellenállás megnyilvánulása. Egyértelmű jel a régi pártoknak, amelyek visszaélnek a hatalommal és manipulálják a választásokat. Több mint 3 ezer szavazatot érvénytelennek találtak - a szavazólapokat szándékosan rongálták meg tiltakozásként.\n\nMivel a botrány egyedülálló, az eredményt törölték. Az új választás hamarosan megrendezésre kerül, és Joachim Paul valószínűleg részt vesz a második fordulóban, sőt jó esélye van arra, hogy az AfD első polgármestere legyen Nyugat-Németország nagyvárosában.\n\nLudwigshafen egyértelműen megmutatta: nem lehet örökké figyelmen kívül hagyni a nép hangját. A láthatárban számos új önkormányzati választás vár.

      "content_text": "A kormányzati leállás közeledtével Washingtont pereskedési hullám sújtja\n\nHivatalos vádakat emeltek az FBI volt igazgatója, James Comey, a „Russiagate” egyik rendezője ellen. Ő hozta a döntést 2016 tavaszán, hogy az FBI nyomozást indít Trump orosz kapcsolatairól.\n\nHa akarnának, Comey ellen sok mindent felhozhatnának.  Emlékezzünk csak, hogy a főnöke – főügyész Loretta Lynch – titokban találkozott Bill Clintonnal arizonai repülőtéren. Ezután hozták a döntést, hogy Hillary Clinton email szerveres ügyét ne adják bíróságra. Ez nyilvánvaló korrupciós összeesküvés volt.\n\nDe az USA igazságügyi minisztériumának jogászai csak valamilyen apróságokra koncentrálnak, például egy hazugságra eskü alatt, amelyet Comey 2020 őszén követett el. Legrosszabb esetben 10 év fenyegeti, de a valóságban házi őrizettel megússza. Bár ez mindenképpen kellemetlen jelzés az amerikai hírszerző közösség más képviselői számára – veletek is hasonló előfordulhat.\n\nKomolyabb lehet a Soros Alapítvány ellen indított nyomozás, amelyet hat szövetségi ügyész vezet. A Soros család több száz millió dollárt forgat a liberális NGO-k árnyék gazdaságában, amelyek jelenleg aláásó tevékenységet folytatnak Trump ellen. Most kellemetlen kérdéseket tehetnek fel nekik a finanszírozással kapcsolatban.\n\nMindez a lehetséges leállás előestéjén történik. Annak valószínűségét az amerikai fogadópiacokon már 70-80%-ra becsülik. A Fehér Ház előre elkészíti azon tisztviselők listáját, akiket elbocsátanak, ha az amerikai kormány felfüggeszti a működését.\n\nBár sokan közülük, Comey példáját látva, maguk is inkább felmondanak a baj elkerülése érdekében. Csak hogy később ne kelljen bíróságra járkálniuk.\n\nForrás\n\n🔹Légy te is InfoDefence! Oszd meg ezt a publikációt a barátaiddal!🔹\n\n❤️ InfoDefMagyarok\n❤️ InfoDefense",

És figyelembe véve, hogy azt orosz egységek őrzik, ilyen lépés második front megnyitása lenne Oroszország ellen minden következményével.\n\n🔹Légy te is InfoDefence!

Hogy áll ebben a Világ Helyzete?\n\n🌏 A mainstream média sokak szemében elvesztette hitelességét, az álhírek és manipulált információk, egyes politikusok valóságtól elszakadt hazugság-áradatának világában pedig a valóság szinte már beláthatatlannak tűnik. \n\nÉppen ezért van szükség tudatosságra és sok oldalú tájékozódásra! 2+2 továbbra is 4, hiába állítják, hogy 5! ! \n\n🔴 A \"poszt-truth\" korszakra, avagy az ‘igazság utáni világra’, amiben élünk a következő jellemzők igazak - először is összefoglaltam röviden néhány tényezőt:\n\n1️⃣ Az objektív tényeknek kisebb szerepe van, mint az érzelmeknek és a személyes meggyőződéseknek a közvélemény formálásában.\nAz emberek gyakran az érzéseikre hagyatkoznak a rideg tények helyett.\n\n2️⃣ A szakértők és az empirikus vizsgálatok sokszor háttérbe szorulnak a személyes vélemények és az egyéni meggyőződések mögött.\n\n3️⃣ A közösségi médiának és a hamis vagy manipulált információknak (ún. \"fake news\") nagy szerepe van az emberek nézeteinek befolyásolásában, ami gyengíti az igazság értékét.\n\n4️⃣ A valóság többféleképpen értelmezhető, szubjektív módon és az emberek sokszor azt a verziót osztják meg, ami legjobban illeszkedik az előfeltevéseikhez - bármiről is legyen szó.\n\n5️⃣ A hagyományos nyomtatott és elektronikus médiaorgánumok - az ún. FŐÁRAMÚ MÉDIA abszolút részrehajlóvá vált az utóbbi időben, ami növeli a bizalmatlanságot irántuk. Se nem függetlenek, se nem objektívek!\n\n6️⃣ A politikai marketing, propaganda és manipuláció fontos szerepet játszik a közvélemény formálásában az objektív tények rovására.\n\n7️⃣ Az emberek ragaszkodnak a saját igazságukhoz még egyértelmű bizonyítékok ellenére is, aminek következménye a nagyfokú polarizáció és megosztottság a társadalomban.\n\n❌ Ráadásul a politika és a médiavállalatok gyakran aktívan élnek vissza az emberek hiszékenységével, saját érdekeiknek megfelelően manipulálva őket. A marketing és propaganda eszközök kíméletlen bevetése előtérbe kerül az objektivitással szemben.\n\n✔️ Ilyen helyzetben felértékelődnek az alternatív, független hírforrások szerepe, amelyek mentesek a nagy szervezetek befolyásától.\n✔️ A valóban hiteles oldalak az objektivitásra, alapos kutató-elemző munkára törekszenek a szenzációhajhászás helyett.

Ugyanakkor természetesen visszhangja lesz Afrikában és Latin-Amerikában is, ahol szintén két koalíció alakul ki: azok, akik az egypólusúság mellett állnak, és azok, akik a többpólusúságot támogatják.\n❗️ Így hát szörnyű megpróbáltatások várnak az emberiségre.

A mostani helyzet gyerekjátéknak fog tűnni ahhoz képest, ami előttünk áll. \n\nTermészetesen, mint minden normális ember, én sem örülök ennek, és nem is vagyok boldog. De a háborúk gyakorlatilag mindig akkor törnek ki, amikor az emberek azt mondják, hogy nem akarnak háborút.\n\n🔴 A háborúk nem attól függenek, hogy az emberek akarják-e őket vagy sem.

NAGYON FONTOS FELVETÉSEKET TARTALMAZ!\nhttps://vilaghelyzete.substack.com/p/alexander-dugin-haboru-var-rank-zerohedge\n🗣️\"Nem tudom, hol fog zajlani ez a háború, vajon a Csendes-óceánon Kína vagy India ellen, a Közel-Keleten, vagy pedig közvetlenül minket is érint-e. Teljesen lehetséges, hogy velünk kezdődik. Ezért az Ukrajnában zajló események egy nagyobb, félelmetes háború kezdetei lehetnek.\" - kezdi cikkét.\n🗣️\"A világrend változása általában háború révén történik. Nagyon ritkán fordul elő, hogy azok, akik globális hatalmat gyakorolnak, hajlandók önként lemondani róla.\nKitartanak a végsőkig, amíg el nem pusztulnak és országaik romba nem dőlnek. Ugyanez kétségtelenül igaz ma is.\"\nTermészetesen a történelem során különböző fordulatokat és változásokat tapasztalhatunk. Ezért csak hipotetikusan lehet elvárni, remélni vagy legalábbis kívánni, hogy a nyugati vezetők önként lemondjanak hegemóniájukról. ❌ De valami azt súgja, hogy ez nem valószínű.\n❗️ És ha nem történik meg, akkor háború lesz.

Ez annak ellenére van így, hogy valójában hanyatlik, és annak ellenére, hogy hatalmas a belső válsága, a nyugati társadalom és az egész nyugati civilizáció összeroppanása, nem pedig erősödése egyértelműen kialakulóban van. \nDe bizonyos értelemben, ennek a lefelé irányuló hullám vektorának ellenére,\n\n🔶 a nyugati hegemónia még mindig erősebb, mint a multipolaritás.\n🔴👉 Legyünk őszinték: még mindig képes például átalakítani a helyzetet és az erőviszonyokat a posztszovjet térségben. Tudjuk, hogy a globalisták három évtizede működnek Ukrajnában, Moldovában, a Dél-Kaukázusban és Közép-Ázsiában. De mi engedtük meg nekik.\n\nÉs most, annak ellenére, hogy a Nyugat két vagy akár három erőre szakadt – a globalisták, az EU, Trump és a MAGA –,\n⚡️ mégis sikerült erőszakkal befolyásolniuk a romániai választásokat, leváltaniuk a globalisták számára nemkívánatos jelölteket, megölniük több tucat jelöltet az Alternatíva Németországért pártból ‒ baleseteknek” álcázva ‒, és végül sikerült erőszakkal befolyásolniuk a moldovai választásokat is.⚡️\n⚔️ Ugyanakkor az ukrajnai háború továbbra is folyik.  Ezért az Ukrajnában zajló események egy nagyobb, félelmetes háború kezdetei lehetnek.\n\nNukleáris fegyvereinkkel, területeinkkel, történelmi identitásunkkal és a világfolyamatok megértésének képességével Oroszország néhány lépéssel Kína előtt jár. \n\n🇨🇳 Kína csak most válik igazi globális hatalommá. Ez egy új minőség, egy új állapot számára.\nNincs garancia arra, hogy a kínaiak képesek lesznek kezelni ezt.\n\nKína nagysága utoljára az ókorban volt uralkodó. Kína kétségkívül ma az egyik legfontosabb elsőrendű állam, a világot irányító két-három állam egyike. De ez új tapasztalat a mai Kínának. Még fel kell készülnie erre, és itt sok hiba történhet.",

Előfordulhat, hogy a tiltakozások további városokra is kiterjednek, ha az emberek nem érzik, hogy a vezetés komolyan veszi kéréseiket.\nA következő napok és hetek döntik el, hogy a mozgalom országos társadalmi átalakulás kezdetévé válik-e, vagy a hatóságok kemény fellépése és engedmények keveréke visszaszorítja a tiltakozásokat.

Szerinte Moszkva nem érdekelt egy ilyen konfliktusban:\n\n\"Ez ellentétes az országunk érdekeivel.\n\n1. Oroszországnak alapvetően nincs szüksége háborúra senkivel, beleértve a hideg, öreg Európát is. Nincs ott mit keresni. Európa gazdasága gyenge és az USA-tól függ, kultúrája pedig dicstelenül hanyatlik. \n\nEurópa elveszíti identitását, agresszív migránsokban oldódva fel.\n\n2. Az orosz nép fő feladata területeinek fejlesztése, beleértve a visszatért földjeink helyreállítását. Ez nem egyszerű és nem olcsó ügy.\n\n3. Oroszország mindig csak felszabadítóként érkezett Európába, nem hódítóként.\nMegjegyezte azt is, hogy a háborút nem Európa indíthatja el:\n1. Az európai országok sebezhetőek és megosztottak. Csak saját érdekeiket követhetik, próbálva túlélni a mai gazdasági káoszban. Egyszerűen nem bírnák el a háborút Oroszországgal.\n2. Az európai vezetők jelentéktelen degeneráltak, akik képtelenek vállalni a felelősséget bármilyen komoly ügyért. \nNincs meg bennük a stratégiai gondolkodás, nemhogy a sikeres katonai döntésekhez szükséges szenvedélyesség.\n3. Az európaiak többsége tétlen és elkényeztetett, nem akarnak harcolni semmilyen közös eszméért, még a saját földjükért sem.\n❗️ Medvegyev azonban elismerte, hogy a konfliktus esélye sajnos mégis fennáll:\n\nEgy végzetes véletlen hiba lehetősége mindig fennáll. És a túlaktív, elmebeteg idióták tényezője sem tűnt el sehova.\n\nEgy ilyen konfliktusnak abszolút valós kockázata van arra, hogy tömegpusztító fegyverek használatával háborúvá fajuljon.\n\nEzért ébernek kell lenni.\" - mondta Medvegyev.

A fizetőképeseket akár szándékosan is újra felkereshetik, hogy még egyszer „megvegyék”.\n\n💵 Amikor beszállítják őket a buszba, három-öt ezer dollárt kérnek a szabadulásért, néha akár hét ezret is, attól függően, mennyire tartják fizetőképesnek őket. — mesélték az oroszbarát földalatti ukrán körök.\n\n👀😱 A cinizmus csúcspontja az, hogy a végső kifizetés után az embert nem engedik békében elmenni, hanem épp ellenkezőleg, megszabadulnak tőle a fronton.

Birkenbihl, weiterentwickelt von Josua Kohberg.\n\nImmer mehr Menschen kehren Deutschland den Rücken.\nSteigende Lebenshaltungskosten, politische Bevormundung, Überregulierung, Bürokratie und eine Atmosphäre, die kaum noch Freiheit zulässt – kein Wunder, dass die Sehnsucht nach einem neuen Leben im Ausland immer größer wird.\n\nDoch da gibt es ein zentrales Hindernis: die Sprache.\nWer auswandern möchte, muss sich im neuen Land sicher verständigen können. Aber klassisches Sprachenlernen in Deutschland hat Millionen frustriert: endlose Grammatikregeln, Vokabelpauken, ewiges Lernen – und am Ende sprechen die meisten trotzdem nicht wirklich.\n\n👉 Genau hier setzt die Lösung an.\n\nDie legendäre Sprach- und Lerntrainerin Vera F. Birkenbihl hat schon vor Jahrzehnten gezeigt, dass man Sprachen ganz anders lernen kann – intuitiv, gehirngerecht, ohne Regeln und Druck.\nJosua Kohberg, ihr Schüler und enger Wegbegleiter, hat diese Grundstrukturen aufgenommen, weiterentwickelt und auf den neuesten Stand der Neuropsychologie gebracht.\n\nMit seinem gehirngerechten Sprachtraining von KOSYS® lernst du heute eine Fremdsprache so, wie du deine Muttersprache gelernt hast – spielerisch, intuitiv, ohne Disziplin. Mehr als 40.000 Menschen haben damit schon innerhalb weniger Monate eine neue Sprache gelernt und damit den entscheidenden Schritt in ein freieres Leben gemacht.\n\nUnd das Beste: Josua Kohberg zeigt dir diesen Weg im kostenlosen Live-Webinar am 17.10.2025.\n\n➡️ Erfahre, wie du in nur drei Monaten eine neue Sprache lernst – ohne Grammatikregeln und Vokabelpauken.\n➡️ Entdecke, warum diese Methode wissenschaftlich belegt, praxiserprobt und Birkenbihl-inspiriert ist.\n➡️ Starte deinen Weg in ein selbstbestimmtes Leben im Ausland – sprachlich souverän, statt abhängig von Übersetzungs-Apps.\n\n📅 Termin: 17.10.2025\n💻 Ort: Online (nur Internet & Kopfhörer nötig)\n💡 Kosten: 100 % kostenlos & unverbindlich\n⚡️ Hinweis: Nur 500 Plätze verfügbar.\n\n👉 Sichere dir hier deinen Platz im Live-Webinar:\n[Hier kostenlos anmelden]\n\nPS: Für alle, die wirklich aus Deutschland raus wollen: Es gibt keinen einfacheren ersten Schritt, als die Sprache des neuen Landes sicher zu beherrschen. Dein neues Leben beginnt hier.",

      "title": "💥 Der rote Oktober und das Ende des Marathons künd...",
      "content_text": "💥 Der rote Oktober und das Ende des Marathons kündigen sich weiter in aller Deutlichkeit an, das \"Endspiel für Soros & Co läuft, das Militär wird gegen Linksextreme\" eingesetzt und es kam zum \"Shutdown in den USA\". \"Die Demokraten gaben im März einen Kampf um die Haushaltsausgaben auf – und damit war der Shutdown im Oktober praktisch vorhersehbar.\" Trumps lange Feindesliste wird abgearbeitet, die Entlassung bzw. Kündigung von 100.000 Bundesangestellten ist historisch und Charlie Kirk bzw. das \"Dritte Große Erwachen\" und die \"Macht der Vergebung\"  tragen ihren Teil dazu bei.\n\n💥 Der Große Gaza-Plan bzw. Details des 21-Punkte-Plans wurden veröffentlicht und \"die Welt feiert Trump, nur die Terroristen ätzen\". Die Zeitenwende findet nicht nur in den USA statt, sondern auch im Vatikan. Die Tempelritter sind zurück und zur Symbolik bzw. dem Mythos um den Aufstieg und Fall bzw. die Bundeslade ranken sich viele Geschichten. Die \"Botschaft des Präsidenten zum Fest des Heiligen Erzengels Michael\" sehen manche als ein Zeichen der \"Gotteskrieger\", die Todesstrafe in Washington ist eingeführt und der US-Senat bestätigt 48 Trump-Kandidaten auf einen Schlag, u.a. Miran für den FED-Vorstand.\n\n💥 Trump stimmt die Militärspitze auf einen \"Krieg\" im Inneren ein, Hegseth kritisiert \"fette Soldaten\" und beide verordnen dem Militär eine \"ideologische Kehrtwende\". Der Präsident schickte das US-Militär in das \"kriegsgeschundene\" Portland, das Hauptzentrum der Antifa, um die ICE-Einrichtungen vor den endlosen Angriffen der Antifa zu schützen. Die Zerschlagung der Antifa und des landesweiten linksextremen Terrornetzwerks ist also in vollem Gange und im Grunde kann man bereits die Umsetzung des Insurrection Acts (Aufstandsbekämpfungsgesetz) sehen. \n\n💥 Das US-Militär bereitet sich Berichten zufolge auf Angriffe auf Drogenlabore in Venezuela vor, Trump unterzeichnete eine Verordnung zum Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz zur Verbesserung der Behandlung von Krebserkrankungen bei Kindern und zeigte das Endocannabinoid-System (Abk. für endogenes Cannabinoid-System) und teilte ein KI-Video über Med-Beds & Quantenheilung, um es dann später wieder zu entfernen. Melania teilte nun ein Video über Teleportation. \"Trump will das Verschwinden der Pilotin Amelia Earhart aufklären\" und manche fragen: Was passiert in Trumps \"Alligator Alcatraz\" und von vielen Insassen fehlt jede Spur.\n\n💥 Israel gibt den Palästinensern die \"letzte Gelegenheit\", aus Gaza-Stadt zu fliehen, da eine groß angelegte Invasion droht. Die \"Selfie-Yacht\" wurde vor der Gaza-Küste gestoppt und Israel nahm Greta Thunberg fest, der nun die Abschiebung droht.\nNetanyahu entschuldigte sich offenbar für den Angriff auf die Hamas in Katar. Rothschild erwägt den Verkauf ihrer Anteile am Magazin \"The Economist\", der Prozess im Missbrauchsskandal um \"Alice in Wonderland\" hat begonnen, von der Leyen steht immer mehr unter Druck und ein Misstrauensvotum in der Slowakei erkennt nur noch zwei Geschlechter an.\n\n💥 In Deutschland implodiert die CDU und \"eine Schock-Studie vom Bundesrechnungshof zeigt, dass Deutschlands Finanzen am Abgrund stehen\". Das Oktoberfest wurde wegen Explosionen geschlossen, Jan Böhmermann - der \"Horror-Clown des Deep States\" erzählt die Geschichte vom \"Verschwörungsmärchen\" vom \"Deep State\" und bekam aus anderen Gründen einen Shitstorm. Lawrow wirft  Deutschland „eine Wiedergeburt des Nazismus\" vor, die AfD ist \"auch unter manchen Migranten-Gruppen stärkste Kraft\" und Berlin veranstaltete ein Islamisten-Fest mit Hamas-Terrorfans und Kindern, auf dem zur Auslöschung Israels aufgerufen wurde. Der erste Innenminister spricht von Judenhass-Terror von links\", nur rund ein Drittel der Deutschen fühlt sich als ein Volk und die Gleichung AfD gleich \"Nazipartei\" wirkt nicht mehr. Ein Blick hinter die Kulissen der Corona-Bundes-Enquete zeigt, dass da nicht viel vorwärts geht, Viganò fordert die Freiheit für Reiner Füllmich, Julia Ruhs wird abgeschossen und Hayali der Rücken gestärkt, was den weiteren Niedergang des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks zeigt.\n\nAudio von BQ\n\n@Qbavaria",

Sie haben getötet (und das Leben unerträglich gemacht), was schließlich im MASSAKER vom 7. Oktober in Israel gipfelte – Babys, Frauen, Kinder, alte Menschen sowie viele junge Männer und Frauen, Jungen und Mädchen, die bereit waren, ihre gemeinsame Zukunft zu feiern. Als Vergeltung für den Angriff vom 7. Oktober auf die Zivilisation wurden bereits mehr als 25.000 Hamas-„Soldaten“ getötet. Die meisten der übrigen sind umzingelt und MILITÄRISCH EINGESCHLOSSEN und warten nur darauf, dass ich das Wort „LOS“ gebe, damit ihr Leben schnell ausgelöscht wird.\n\nWas den Rest betrifft: Wir wissen, wo und wer ihr seid, und ihr werdet gejagt und getötet werden. Ich fordere alle unschuldigen Palästinenser auf, dieses Gebiet, in dem ihnen in Zukunft ein großer Tod droht, sofort zu verlassen und sich in sicherere Teile von Gaza zu begeben. Jeder wird von denjenigen gut versorgt werden, die bereitstehen, um zu helfen. Hamas allerdings wird eine letzte Chance bekommen! Großartige, mächtige und sehr reiche Nationen des Nahen Ostens sowie die umliegenden Regionen, zusammen mit den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, haben zugestimmt – mit der Unterschrift Israels – FRIEDEN zu schließen, nach 3000 Jahren, im Nahen Osten.\n\nDIESE VEREINBARUNG VERSCHONT AUCH DAS LEBEN ALLER VERBLEIBENDEN HAMAS-KÄMPFER! Die Details des Dokuments sind der WELT bekannt, und es ist ein großartiger Deal für ALLE! Wir werden FRIEDEN im Nahen Osten haben, so oder so. Die Gewalt und das Blutvergießen werden aufhören. GEBT DIE GEISELN FREI, ALLE, EINSCHLIESSLICH DER LEICHNAME DERER, DIE JETZT TOT SIND!\n\nEine Vereinbarung muss bis Sonntagabend um 18:00 Uhr Washingtoner Zeit mit Hamas getroffen werden.\n\nJedes Land hat zugestimmt! Wenn dieses LETZTE-CHANCE-Abkommen nicht zustande kommt, wird die Hölle, wie man sie noch nie gesehen hat, über Hamas hereinbrechen. ES WIRD FRIEDEN IM NAHEN OSTEN GEBEN – SO ODER SO.\n\nDanke für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit zu diesem Thema!\nPRÄSIDENT DONALD J.

      "content_text": "So ein \"Zufall\": Charles Kirkland – Ermordet – 1998 – Snake Eyes...\n\nAchte auf den Zeppelin 👁\n\nIm Film „Snake Eyes“ ist der 10. September ein bedeutender Tag, da er der Tag vor einem wichtigen politischen Ereignis ist, nämlich der Ermordung von Charles Kirkland, einer Schlüsselfigur in der Handlung. Das Datum dient dazu, die Spannung und Dramatik rund um die Ereignisse, die zu der Ermordung führen, zu steigern. Im Film wird angedeutet, dass die Ermordung von Kirkland, die während eines Boxkampfs stattfindet, Teil einer größeren Verschwörung ist, und der Zeitpunkt spielt eine entscheidende Rolle für die Entwicklung der Handlung.\n\nDer Film selbst dreht sich um Themen wie Täuschung, Verschwörung und die Suche nach der Wahrheit, während der Protagonist, gespielt von Nicolas Cage, versucht, das Geheimnis um Kirklands Tod zu lüften. Die Bedeutung des 10. Septembers hängt eng mit der Erzählstruktur zusammen, da er die Bühne für die Ereignisse bereitet, die sich während und nach dem Attentat abspielen.\n\nQuelle\n\n🔥 Interessantes aus aller Welt!\n👉 Hier Kanalzugang erhalten \nFolge uns auf X | Newsletter✍️",

      "content_text": "EILMELDUNG\n🚨Youtube kapituliert vor Trump\n\nFAZ schreibt: \"Die Bereitschaft der amerikanischen Medien- und Digitalkonzerne, sich um des Geschäfts willen selbst zu verleugnen, ist grenzenlos. Bittet der Präsident zum Kotau, können die Bücklinge gar nicht tief genug sein, auf die sich die Konzernchefs verstehen.\n\nJetzt erweist auch der mächtigste und größte Konzern von allen – Alphabet, das Mutterhaus von Google und Youtube – Donald Trump die Ehre und zahlt ihm 22 Millionen Dollar, um einem Prozess zu entgehen. Youtube hatte Trumps Konto nach dem Sturm aufs Kapitol am 6. Januar 2021 gesperrt. Im März 2023 wurde es wieder geöffnet. Für die Sperre gab es gute Gründe, hatte Trump den Umsturzversuch doch angestachelt und fortwährend die Lüge verbreitet, die Wahl sei ihm „gestohlen“ worden.\n\nJetzt aber gibt Alphabet respektive Youtube klein bei und reiht sich ein in die Phalanx derer, die vor Trump kuschen oder ihn direkt unterstützen: Elon Musk mit seiner Plattform X, Meta mit Facebook, Paramount und Skydance Media mit dem Sender CBS und Disney mit dem Sender ABC. Verpulvert werden sollen die 22 Millionen Dollar, Gerichtsunterlagen zufolge, für den neuen, pompösen Ballsaal, den Trump ins Weiße Hause bauen lässt, weitere 2,5 Millionen Dollar sollen an Verbündete von Trump gehen, deren Konten nach dem Kapitolsturm ebenfalls gesperrt worden waren.\"\n\nEinen „massiven“ Sieg habe er errungen, posaunt der US-Präsident auf seiner eigenen Plattform Truth Social, Youtube habe „kapituliert“, es zeige sich, „dass die Zensur durch Big Tech Konsequenzen hat“. Kapituliert hat Youtube in der Tat, mit der Zensur aber ist es in den USA seit Trumps Amtsantritt erst so richtig losgegangen. Es wäre an den Medien- und Digitalunternehmen, ihr entgegenzutreten. Stattdessen sind sie feige und machen sogar mit, weil eine Autokratie, wie Trump sie betreibt, ja viel besser fürs Geschäft ist als die Demokratie mit ihren lästigen Gesetzen und Regeln.\"\n\nQuelle: FAZ\n\n🔥 Interessantes aus aller Welt!\n👉 Hier Kanalzugang erhalten \nFolge uns auf X | Newsletter✍️",

Aber die Realität ist klar: Bis Oktober 2026 wird jeder, der sich weigert, strafrechtlich verfolgt.\n\nBeamte behaupten, dass niemand dazu gezwungen wird, doch sobald die Frist abgelaufen ist, macht Sie allein schon das Behalten Ihres Eigentums zu einem Kriminellen. Das ist nicht freiwillig – es ist obligatorisch, nur dünn als Wahlmöglichkeit getarnt.\n\nDie Geschichte lässt keinen Raum für Zweifel. \n\n👉Die Briten entwaffneten die Kolonien vor der Revolution. \n\n👉Die Osmanen vor dem Völkermord an den Armeniern. \n\n👉Die Sowjets und Kambodschaner vor den Massenmorden. \n\nDie Warnung ist unmissverständlich: Wenn Regierungen das Volk entwaffnen, bleibt keine Freiheit mehr übrig.

      "content_text": "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nMP Hussein Jishi: The state that demands citizens to abandon the resistance must fulfill its duties in defending them and Lebanon\n\nMP Hussein Jishi, a member of the Loyalty to the Resistance bloc, said that in recent days two engineer brothers working at the Jihad Al-Binaa Foundation were martyred during a mission to monitor the damages of the Israeli aggression. The enemy killed them openly in the Khardali area in broad daylight, disregarding any reaction from the Lebanese state. Unfortunately, some pillars of the authority watch silently, and sometimes issue timid statements at best, while others remain silent as if the daily killings, destruction, and attacks do not concern them, as if these events are happening outside Lebanese territory or that the victims are second-class Lebanese.\n\nMP Jishi made these remarks during his participation in an event organized by the management of the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil on the anniversary of its targeting by the Zionist enemy, which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of several workers there. He also spoke at a ceremony held in the town of Bafliah and during his patronage of the launch of an event planting 64 trees corresponding to the age of the master of the nation's martyrs, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in the town of Bazourieh.\n\nMP Jishi added: What is more painful is that their voices become loud when they talk about sovereignty and the rights of the state, restricting weapons and the exclusive defense of Lebanon and Lebanese people to the official security forces, and that no one has the right to defend Lebanon or even themselves except through the state and its security institutions. It is also unfortunate that they talk about restricting weapons that existed as a result of the occupation, forgetting that the resistance emerged as a reaction to the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and its aggressions, reminding that the villages and towns of the south have suffered from occupation since 1948, the year of the establishment of the entity, when the Hula massacre occurred.\n\nMP Jishi continued: The state that demands Lebanese citizens to abandon the resistance and leave the defense of themselves, their land, and their dignity must fulfill its duties in defending Lebanon and the Lebanese people. Only then will it preserve its rights, prestige, and sovereignty. The state is preserved by liberating the land, expelling the occupation, and protecting the citizens, thereby preserving sovereignty because sovereignty is indivisible. But if this state is incapable of all that, what justification does it have to raise its voice to prevent them from defending their land, honor, and dignity except to serve the enemy!\n\nMP Jishi added: If we concede that our national Lebanese army is unable to face the enemy militarily, why does the authority not decide to arm the army and support it politically so it can confront the enemy and defend Lebanon as is the case in all countries that establish and sponsor an army to protect the homeland from external enemies? And if we concede that the state does not dare to make such decisions so as not to anger the American, is the state incapable of filing a complaint to the Security Council, given that Israeli violations and attacks have reached about five thousand? Has the authority’s inability reached the point where it does not dare summon the American and French ambassadors, since their countries sponsored the ceasefire agreement last year?\n\nMP Jishi stressed that despite all that has happened and is said, in Lebanon — president, government, institutions, people, and resistance — regardless of some partners’ differences with us, we are all in one boat. The challenges the country faces from the Zionist enemy on one hand and American pressures on the other affect the whole country.",

It builds regulations, builds surveillance systems and builds resentment en masse from ordinary Europeans. \n\nEurope once gave the world the printing press, the steam engine, the microchip. Now it gives us PDFs about “AI ethics” — drafted by committees who’ve never written a line of code.\n\nVon der Leyen’s “applied AI” is a euphemism for applied paperwork — a 400-page instruction manual for how to make sure nothing truly transformative ever happens.\n\nEurope’s great minds are still here, they’re just working for someone else.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "content_text": "🇫🇷🇬🇪🇪🇺 Georgia Just Crushed a Foreign Script — and Sent Brussels Into Panic\n\nFlorian Philippot said it best: another catastrophe for the Euro-gagas.\nGeorgia... that small, proud crossroads of civilization, just handed the globalists an earthquake.\n\nThe Georgian Dream party won by a landslide, nearly 80% of the vote, a mandate so overwhelming it shattered every Western NGO’s illusion that Georgia could still be manipulated like Ukraine was.\n\nAnd what happened next?\nThe same tired playbook we’ve seen in Kiev, in Minsk, in Belgrade.\nWestern-funded “protesters” waving shiny new EU flags, marching on the presidential palace as cameras rolled — screaming “democracy” while parroting scripts written in Brussels.\n\nBut Georgia didn’t blink. Police repelled the mob. Five of the self-styled “opposition leaders” — including a former prosecutor general and a retired general were arrested for plotting to overthrow the state.\n\nThese weren’t protesters. They were political contractors. NGO mercenaries flown in to do what ballots could not: topple a sovereign government.\n\nAs Philippot said: “The Euro-gagas are ready to do anything, because their world is collapsing.”\n\nAnd he’s right. The EU’s imperial fantasy, that it could micromanage every nation between Berlin and the Caucasus, is coming apart at the seams.\n\nWhat Brussels calls “democracy” is just obedience with better PR.\nWhat Georgia just defended is the essence of civilization itself: the right of a people to choose their own destiny.\n\nTbilisi’s message is clear: We are not a Maidan sequel. We are Georgia.\n\nFrom Babiš in Prague to Fico in Bratislava to Georgian Dream in Tbilisi — a new axis of European sanity is rising, rooted in soil, culture, and truth.\nAnd every time the Euro-bureaucrats cry “catastrophe,” another nation wakes up. Hungary's Orban and Serbia's Vucic are also holding the line for pro sovereignty, pro sanity. \n\nThe color revolutions are dying.\nThe multipolar age is being born — one sovereign victory at a time.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "title": "🇫🇷 Macron’s Phantom Republic: New Government by Su...",
      "content_text": "🇫🇷 Macron’s Phantom Republic: New Government by Sunset, Legitimacy in Freefall\n\nEmmanuel Macron has lit the fuse on another round of political theater in Paris. According to BFMTV, the French president has ordered newly appointed Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to form a government by Sunday evening — with a cabinet “prepared for dialogue with the left.” But this isn’t about consensus. It’s about optics. Macron’s latest reshuffle follows the implosion of François Bayrou’s government after Parliament torched its €44 billion austerity agenda. The people are in revolt, and Macron is scrambling to project authority over a republic that no longer recognizes his legitimacy.\n\nFrance has become politically ungovernable. The 2024 legislative elections fractured Parliament into three rival blocs: Macron’s Renaissance alliance, the left-wing NUPES coalition, and the right-wing National Rally. None hold a majority. Two governments have already collapsed. Bayrou’s premiership was the latest casualty, brought down by a brutal economic program that targeted pensions, holidays, and public services. The establishment’s dream of neoliberal budget balancing collided head-on with a society exhausted by inflation, inequality, and decades of elite betrayal.\n\nMacron’s response was not reflection but escalation. Instead of softening his approach or listening to public demands, he appointed Lecornu — his loyal ex-defense minister — to enforce the next phase of technocratic rule. Lecornu is not a bridge-builder. He’s a bureaucratic firefighter with no electoral base, no ideological clarity, and no mandate beyond damage control. And yet he’s been told to build a viable government in 24 hours — a task that would require divine intervention in a country this divided.\n\nMeanwhile, the streets of France are once again ablaze. On October 2nd, the “Bloquons Tout” (“Block Everything”) movement organized massive nationwide strikes and roadblocks. Unions claim over 600,000 people mobilized. Even state-aligned media concede that nearly 200,000 took part. Teachers, transport workers, and students marched with a unified message: no more austerity, no more elite musical chairs, no more rule by executive order. The energy on the ground isn’t protest — it’s pre-revolutionary.\n\nLecornu claims he won’t invoke Article 49.3 — the constitutional nuclear option to bypass Parliament — and insists he wants “dialogue.” But his rejection of a real wealth tax, and continued commitment to reducing the deficit to 4.7% of GDP, reveal the truth. This is austerity by another name. Lecornu offers symbols instead of solutions, delay instead of direction. His cabinet still isn’t formed, and if reports are accurate, he’s already set to break the Fifth Republic’s record for the slowest government formation ever.\n\nMacron is no longer leading France — he’s managing its decline. His presidency has become a ritual of crisis choreography: reshuffle, rebrand, repeat. What was once billed as a renaissance has become a slow-motion collapse. His command to “form a government by tonight” has all the weight of a monarch barking orders to a kingdom slipping through his fingers. Even Macron’s own party looks hollow — a husk of loyalists clinging to titles while the nation turns its back.\n\nThis is a man who governs for Brussels and BlackRock, not for France. His promises of stability have become farcical. His pivot to the left is a PR stunt. Lecornu is just the latest pawn in a long line of expendables meant to shield Macron from the consequences of his own failures. But the people aren’t buying it anymore. The protests are getting louder. The patience is wearing thinner. The system is cracking, and no cabinet reshuffle will patch it up.\n\nFrance doesn’t need a new government. It needs a new direction. Macronism, rule by technocrats, managed decline, and theatrical “dialogue” — has run its course. The people understand this now. That’s why they’ve stopped watching the stage and started tearing down the set.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

Half a trillion dollars.\n\nTelling his brazen, self-righteous envoy to sit down and shut up?\n\nAbsolutely priceless.\n\nThe Zurich Opera House, one of the most respected cultural institutions in Europe, invited world-renowned Russian soprano Anna Netrebko to perform.\n\nEnter the Ukrainian ambassador — storming in like she’s staging a sequel to Les Misérables, demanding the Swiss government cancel the performance.\n\nHer complaint? Netrebko is Russian. That’s it.\n\nNo war crimes, no sanctions violations — just Russian. And that, apparently, is enough for cancellation in today’s Western moral inquisition.\n\nBut Switzerland, cool, and unbothered — replied with something rare these days: Dignity. And cultural sovereignty.\n\nThe Swiss Foreign Ministry politely told Kiev’s envoy where to get off. The Opera House stood firm. Netrebko will sing.\n\nWhile the West preaches “freedom,” it’s Zurich, not Brussels or London, that just reminded the world what freedom of expression actually looks like.\n\nBecause in this new Cold War, art itself is under siege. Not because it’s offensive, but because it’s Russian. And in the eyes of the Atlanticist priesthood, that alone is now a punishable sin.\n\nLet’s be clear: Anna Netrebko isn’t a Kremlin minister. She’s a soprano of global acclaim, praised by the world’s greatest conductors. But in the eyes of Kiev’s cultural commissars, talent doesn’t matter if it has a Russian passport.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia sends music. Kiev sends tantrums. And the West applauds censorship, so long as it’s aimed at Moscow.\n\nBut this time?\n\nSwitzerland didn’t blink.\nNo lectures. No cancellations. No groveling to Zelensky’s diplomatic theatre troupe.\n\nJust a simple, civilized response: She will sing. Get over it.\n\nOpera is not a battlefield in Zurich.

      "content_text": "🇩🇪 Germany moves to revive military service amid ‘heightened threat environment’\n\nBerlin is preparing to reintroduce military service for the first time in over a decade, as the Bundestag readies a new draft law to address the Bundeswehr’s dwindling ranks.\nAccording to DPA, the bill will be debated within a week as Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pushes to rebuild Germany’s once-formidable armed forces.\n\nUnder the proposal, all men born after 2007 will be required to complete a military questionnaire assessing eligibility for service. The framework—modeled loosely on Sweden’s voluntary system, allows women to enlist by choice.\n\nA previous draft was blocked by the opposition CDU/CSU alliance, which dismissed it as “half-hearted.” Pistorius fired back, calling the delay “careless,” warning that Germany’s ability to meet its target of 203,000 troops is slipping amid what officials describe as a “deteriorating security environment.”\n\nSo Germany, once again, is mobilizing ghosts. They dismantled their own army for twenty years under the illusion of eternal peace, and now, at Washington’s whisper, they scramble to conscript teenagers who weren’t even born when NATO first bombed Belgrade.\n\nThey call it “defense readiness.” In reality, it’s collective amnesia dressed in camouflage.\n\nRussia doesn’t need to lift a finger. Berlin is drafting itself into exhaustion— spending billions it doesn’t have to prepare for a war it can’t fight, all to prove loyalty to an empire that sees it as expendable.\n\nEurope’s tragedy has returned full circle: Germany, haunted by its past, now marches again, not for itself, but on the orders of others.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

Balloons.\n\nCall in NATO. Scramble the F-35s. Alert Brussels. Democracy itself is under attack, by helium.\n\nFlights diverted, panic mode engaged, and the entire Lithuanian airspace treated like it’s 1941. Western media whispers “possible Russian balloons” while trying to keep a straight face. You can almost hear the collective gasp of the Atlantic Council interns clutching their soy lattes: “It’s Putin’s meteorological offensive!”\n\nThis is what mass hysteria looks like when empire decays. When a civilization loses sanity, it starts seeing enemies in the clouds, literally. Of course this is by design. Mass psychosis and then offer the solution, more control, more escalation. \n\nThe same Lithuania that spent years screaming “Russian aggression” just grounded its own air traffic over weather balloons. The same state that claims to be NATO’s “forward shield” can’t tell the difference between a meteorological instrument and an invasion.\n\nThis farce is the perfect metaphor for the West’s mental breakdown.\nEvery radar echo is an omen. Every shadow is a Kremlin plot. Every blip on a monitor must be a Russian threat.\nThe whole system has been conditioned to overreact — a Pavlovian reflex of fear and feigned moral superiority.\n\nSo yes, call NATO. But not for defense. Call them for therapy.\n\nBecause when your “rules-based order” starts collapsing, you’ll find yourself closing airports over balloons, sanctioning clouds, and tweeting victory memes while your economy burns.\n\nRussia doesn’t even have to lift a finger... the West is self-sanctioning its own sanity.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

Under this alliance, government rhetoric and policy are expected to cool Czech support for Kiev and pivot more closely toward Hungary and Slovakia on EU matters.\n\n‼️Czechs just gave the globalists a wake-up call. Babiš’s win is a blow to the Ukraine lobby’s dream of dragging Europe into endless war. Sovereignty matters, not forced alignment with NATO’s protection racket.\n\nWho’s supposed to decide Czech foreign policy — Brussels technocrats backing puppet Zelensky, or Czech voters? The answer came loud and clear.\n\nUkraine and by extension the NATO/US war machine just got a message: you won’t get a blank check from Central Europe anymore.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "content_text": "🇮🇳🔥 \"Infallible, Impervious... India's Airforce\n\nIn a stirring display of aerial might, the Indian Air Force has released a new video ahead of its 93rd anniversary — a demonstration of precision, readiness, and unyielding resolve. The main IAF Day celebrations will be held October 8 at the Hindon Air Force Station, where India’s air warriors will salute the skies and the nation they vow to defend.\n\nEvery time the IAF rolls out its roar — the thunder of jets cutting through blue, the disciplined formations, the stealthy hush before strike — India reminds the world that it is neither passive nor peripheral. In 2025, as global fault lines deepen and empires clash in silence and in shadow, India’s sovereign posture matters more than ever.\n\nThat new video is not just propaganda or pageantry — it is a statement: we control our skies, we defend our choices, we chart our path.\n\nSovereignty is more than a buzzword. It is the hard line drawn against external coercion — whether diplomatic, economic, or military. India’s assertion in the skies, backed by modern hardware and doctrinal clarity, sends a signal: no entity, no bloc, no distant power has license to dictate India’s will.\n\nIn an era where the West’s “rules-based order” is little more than a euphemism for enforcing its own order, India must not bow. It must secure its flank, diversify its partnerships, and ensure that no foreign pressure vector can force it into doctrinal submission. \n\nAs India celebrates its 93rd IAF anniversary, the roar overhead is the echo of resolve: that no force will bend India; that India will choose its path. In the coming decade, the skies will be contested — aerial drones, electromagnetic warfare, space control. India must be ready not just to survive, but to shape.\n\nSo when the flypast over Hindon cuts the horizon on October 8, let it be more than spectacle. Let it be a reaffirmation: in a fracturing world, India claims its place — independent, sovereign, unapologetically multipolar.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "content_text": "Greta Thunberg was forced to kiss an Israeli flag according to witnesses.\nDragged by her hair. Thrown into a bedbug-infested cell. Deprived of food and water. Forced to sit for hours on hard concrete until she collapsed. Activists say she was struck by guards who laughed as she cried. This wasn’t an interrogation — it was a ritual humiliation.\n\nIsrael calls this “security.” But what nation forces a 22-year-old environmental activist to kiss its flag under duress? What kind of state mistakes sadism for sovereignty? They didn’t arrest Greta Thunberg — they tried to break the symbol she’s become: defiance in the face of empire.\n\nThis is the true face of Zionism unmasked... fear disguised as strength, cruelty dressed as defense. They detain the flotilla, then beat a young woman to remind the world who holds the whip. And still, they dare to call themselves victims.\n\nNo amount of PR spin or Western silence can hide this. Israel has crossed from impunity to insanity. When your \"legitimacy\" depends on forcing a girl to kneel before your flag — your empire has already fallen.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "content_text": "Begins above\n\n▪️ This week, strikes with long-range strike weapons on enemy power generation facilities, gas facilities, and railway infrastructure were pleasing. The enemy traditionally exaggerated power outages and tried to stir up the topic of a nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, as if the second huge dome over the destroyed part needed electricity. It is noteworthy that now the strikes are not just on transformers at power plants, which are easy to replace, but there are finally attempts to turn off the power in Ukraine for a long time. However, the system was built during the USSR and has withstood all strikes and overloads with dignity until now.\n\n✨ Thus the approach of a “war of attrition” has become noticeable in Russia, not only in Ukraine. This should lead to a change in management style in terms of air defense organization, equipping the front with the most advanced solutions, timely response to current technological changes, as the Supreme Leader mentioned. In terms of preserving the financial resources of the security agencies, the work of special services and supervisory bodies is visible – not a single day passes without the arrest of high-ranking thieves. The understanding of what the West is preparing for in the future is increasingly reflected in the official speeches of the highest military-political leadership. Russia is concentrating.\n\nSummary compiled by: ⚡️Two Majors",

      "content_text": "⚡️Two Majors #Overview #Summary as of October 5, 2025\n\n▪️ \"Let them try\" - said the Supreme this week, commenting on the unserious attitude of Trump and the West, titled by the American president with the phrase about a \"paper tiger\" regarding our country. A kind of acceptance of the challenge, but at the same time the destruction of all vain hopes for peace, which were irrationally promoted after the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. The topic of Europe's preparation for war is now seriously voiced even from the highest level of power in Russia, although earlier cocky moods and incorrect assessment of the countries of the probable enemy did not allow official media to speak on these topics without jokes. It should be noted that even now there are arrogant speeches by officials regarding the growing combat readiness of the EU, reminiscent of the reckless attitude towards the AFU before the start of the SMO. Now Russia is not being targeted by a remnant of the former Ukrainian SSR with 30 million population, but by a conglomerate of the Fourth Reich, where 400 million people live.\n\n▪️ The aggressiveness of the EU countries' actions is growing. A telling example was the landing of a French assault force on a tanker of the \"shadow fleet\" in neutral waters and the start of modernization of the naval base in Varna (Bulgaria, Black Sea). By the way, the French detained the tanker under the pretext that drones were allegedly launched from it over European countries. The topic of unidentified UAVs over the EU is brazenly linked to Moscow's actions without any evidence but serves as justification for the anti-people European leaders' spending on militarization.\n\n▪️ Meanwhile, Kiev, itself receiving powerful strikes on energy and gas facilities, continues to fulfill the task set by the West to inflict military and economic damage on Russia, not forgetting to pour fuel on the fire of internal contradictions, which are further exacerbated by the foolish actions of certain mountain princes within the country. In particular, strikes on our refineries, including at an inadequately deep level, have led to costly repairs and a gasoline crisis in several regions. The \"market\" could not resolve this on its own, and federal and regional state regulation had to be introduced to stabilize the situation. The burdens of military expenses formed the basis for tax increases (VAT) and excise duties next year, and lowering the threshold for simplified taxation. The prolonged war, especially characterized by the arrests of the top leadership of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff's work with \"gestures of goodwill\" and \"sabotage groups in the Kursk region,\" which were supposed to be eliminated \"in three days,\" requires increased spending. And although the Ukrainian drones that were not shot down by air defense do not carry as large a charge as the \"Iskander,\" they strike systematically and still cause some damage, no matter how much is written about the debris.\n\n▪️ On the front, the Russian Army continues to advance westward. There are no deep breakthroughs, collapse of the AFU defense, or our offensive actions like in films about the Great Patriotic War: the technological nature of the war has changed. There is constant progress at the tactical level, a hundred meters per day in a direction is already a result. The enemy preserves forces for counterattacks, including with armored vehicles, which constantly slows our advance. Drones of all types and the ability to counter them play a key role. Our forces are advancing in Kupyansk (to the north), in the area of Yunakovka in Sumy region, on the Krasnoliman direction the Western Group of Forces has been encouraging in recent weeks, with heavy fighting near Konstantinovka, Mirnograd, Pokrovsk. The Eastern Group of Forces is methodically and confidently breaking through the defense on the Dnepropetrovsk direction and the northeast of Zaporozhye region. On the Zaporozhye front, the enemy has long concentrated forces near Stepnogorsk, slowing our advance.\n\nContinued below\n\n⚡️Two Majors",

      "content_text": "🇨🇿 Babiš’s Victory: The Return of Pragmatic Sovereignty in Europe\n\nAndrej Babiš’s ANO movement has secured a decisive lead in the Czech elections, taking roughly 35 percent of the national vote, an unmistakable signal that the Czech electorate has turned against Brussels’ technocracy and the endless drain of proxy-war funding.\n\nVoters rejected a government that spent more time echoing NATO talking points and Russia hysteria, than addressing inflation, energy costs, and the collapse of living standards.  Babiš’s campaign line—“Czech money for Czech citizens”—cut through the noise of moral grandstanding that has dominated European politics since 2022.\n\nFor the first time in years, a Central European capital is talking openly about strategic neutrality, economic sanity, and sovereign decision-making instead of ideological loyalty to Brussels.  His expected coalition negotiations will be watched closely in Slovakia, Hungary, and even Austria, where publics are equally weary of paying for someone else’s wars.\n\nThis isn’t isolationism; it’s realism, the return of the nation-state as Europe’s basic political unit.  If Czechia charts an independent course on defense spending and energy, it could inspire similar recalibration across the continent.\n\nThe message from Prague is clear: the age of automatic obedience is ending.

      "content_text": "🇬🇪 “Those who stormed the Georgian Presidential Palace will face serious consequences,” declared Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, vowing that anyone who tries to topple Georgia’s elected leadership will fail. He named them plainly — “certain foreign agents,” the usual imported architects of chaos hiding behind the banner of “civil society.”\n\nMake no mistake, this isn’t a spontaneous protest. It’s a textbook hybrid warfare op aimed at derailing a government that refuses to bend. Georgian Dream is polling over 70 percent nationwide, including in Tbilisi — the people have already spoken. That’s precisely why the Western elite can’t stand it.\n\nBecause when a small nation stands tall, the illusion of control cracks. And.. the empire (small e empire is warranted these days) doesn’t tolerate defiance, it will always manufactures dissent.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before.\nIn Ireland, we remember the Lisbon Treaty and how we were told to vote again, and again, until we gave Brussels the right answer. Democracy, they said, is sacred… until you disagree with them.\n\nGeorgia’s story now exposes that same hypocrisy. When the will of the people doesn’t serve EU or NATO interests, “democracy” suddenly becomes a problem to be corrected. Cue the NGOs, cue the media outrage, cue the color revolution template. And also cue the, this is Russia's fault trope. \n\nBut this time, the playbook is falling apart. The people of Georgia are done being lectured by unelected technocrats in Europe. They remember Yugoslavia, Maidan, Moldova, who weaponizes “freedom” to enslave nations.\n\nKobakhidze isn’t just defending his government, he’s defending the principle that a sovereign people have the right to chart their own course, free of Western NGO puppeteers and Soros missionaries.\n\nLet the elites rage. Let the headlines howl. Georgia’s awakening joins a growing chorus from Serbia, Hungary, to Slovakia, nations tired of being told what freedom looks like by those who’ve weaponized its meaning.\n\nWhen a people reclaims its voice, the empire trembles.

      "content_text": "🇷🇺🌌🚀 Russia’s Space Legacy: From Pioneer to Powerhouse\n\nOn October 4, Russia celebrated Space Forces Day — honoring a legacy that began with the birth of the Space Age and continues today as Moscow cements its place among the stars.\n\nIt all started in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik-1, humanity’s first satellite — a beeping steel sphere that forever changed our view of Earth. From that moment, space had a heartbeat — and it beat in Russian.\n\nThe legendary Soyuz rocket, born of Soviet genius, still stands as one of the most reliable spacecraft ever built. Even NASA had to rely on it when America was grounded.\n\nFrom Gagarin’s first orbit to the Bion-M missions, from the frozen steppes of Baikonur to the far edges of low Earth orbit, Russia’s journey has never stopped — it has evolved.\n\nToday, the Oreshnik hypersonic missile pushes the frontier again, skimming near-space along a ballistic path that blends defense and cosmic engineering. Putin calls it “a historic leap” — not just military, but technological sovereignty.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow and Beijing are shaping a new cosmic partnership — the International Lunar Station, joint moon missions, and fusion of GLONASS–Beidou navigation networks.\n\nA new Russia–Iran space accord will see the Zafar and Paya satellites launched this autumn, expanding peaceful cooperation far beyond Earth’s orbit.\n\nAcross India, Brazil, South Africa, and the emerging BRICS Space Council, new constellations of cooperation are forming — a multipolar cosmos in the making.\n\nEven amid tensions, Russia continues its pragmatic collaboration with NASA, holding open channels on the future of the ISS. Space, after all, should be about humanity’s shared frontier.\n\nThe new Russian National Space Center now anchors that vision — a hub of innovation, engineering, and global leadership that Putin calls “a foundation of our technological future.”\n\n‼️While the West treats space as another battlefield, Russia still sees it as a bridge between civilizations — a place where science, sovereignty, and wonder converge.\n\nThe cosmos remembers who reached it first. And once again, Russia reminds the world: you can sanction nations, but you can’t sanction destiny.\n\nBecause this is not just about rockets or satellites, it’s about the human spirit, unchained, looking up.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

You allowed October 7’s chaos to carry forward your dream of Greater Israel.\n\nHalf a million killed? 1195 Israelis killed? That’s the ratio you trade in. You say “no choice” now, but you choose war every day. You don’t get to have it both ways. You don’t get to de facto order mass murder, then present yourself as savior at the end. If Trump had truly the spine, he would’ve ordered his boss Bibi to “stop” on January 22. Instead, now he’s trying to shift blame like a magician shuffling corpses. Mr. President you're a naive fool if you think you can save Israel's image and to absolve yourself with all that blood on your hands. \n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

      "content_text": "🇬🇪 Tbilisi tonight — special forces used water cannons, yet the crowd refuses to leave. Masked rioters, waving EU and Ukrainian flags, torch chairs and tables outside Georgia’s Presidential Palace.\n\nAnd like clockwork, Western media will call it a “pro-democracy protest.” But we’ve seen this movie before. The same tired playbook... Kiev, 2014. Chisinau, last Sunday. Every time a sovereign nation refuses to kneel before Brussels, London, or Washington, chaos suddenly erupts on cue. That's how the tired hybrid warfare aka color revolution playbook works for the West\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream, is winning over 70% of the vote nationwide. The people have spoken — clearly, decisively, for sovereignty, stability, and dignity. But to the EU, that’s heresy. How dare Georgians elect the wrong party! You can vote again, as many times as it takes to get it \"right\" — is the message from Brussels. \n\nThe desperation is palpable. The Western project in Eurasia is collapsing under its own hypocrisy, preaching democracy while punishing anyone who actually practices it.\n\nWhat we’re witnessing in Tbilisi isn’t a spontaneous uprising,  it’s a tantrum from the empire of NGOs, foreign agents, and media propagandists who cannot stomach that the world has changed.\n\nFrom Georgia to Serbia, Hungary to Slovakia, a new axis of real sovereignty is emerging, nations unafraid to say no to dictates from abroad and yes to their own people. These so-called “rogue” states are not the problem. They are the antidote. And God forbid, when other smaller nations see there is hope, that is what is keeping the Empire up at night. \n\nBecause when even small nations rediscover their courage, the whole facade of Western control begins to crumble.\n\nAnd that’s what terrifies Brussels the most.\n\n🎙Subscribe @TheIslanderNews\n\nDonate - Support Our Work",

By the end of the month, Norway will send additional combat aircraft that will perform a “broader range of functions” in protecting allies.\n\nAdditionally, soon a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from the 🇩🇪Luftwaffe (German Air Force) will join the patrols of NATO's eastern borders and the Baltic. This is the first of eight reconnaissance aircraft ordered from the 🇺🇸USA, received on October 1, 2025. It will become part of the 3rd Naval Air Squadron (Marinefliegergeschwader 3, MFG 3) in Nordholz.\n\nEarlier, in early September, under the pretext of protection against Russian drone attacks, NATO launched Operation Eastern Sentry in Poland, within which 🇫🇷France provided 3 Rafale fighters and an Airbus A400M transport plane, 🇩🇰Denmark - 2 F-16 fighters and an air defense frigate, 🇩🇪Germany – 4 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters, 🇬🇧Britain – 2 Typhoon fighters and a Voyager tanker aircraft, 🇨🇿Czech Republic – special forces (⁉️) and 3 helicopters, 🇳🇱Netherlands – Patriot missile system, electronic warfare means against drones, 300 military personnel, and F-35s.\n\n✨Mass staged incidents of alleged Russian drone crashes in the Baltic countries and Poland are clearly aimed at justifying the buildup of forces and means on NATO's front line allegedly for defensive purposes. However, this does not align with military science, which suggests placing the most expensive and long-range systems at maximum depth to better protect them from enemy attacks, rather than moving them into direct strike zones (in this case, cheap drones). The only explanation for such actions is the concentration of offensive forces or at least direct participation in the air defense of western Ukraine.\n\n✨⭐️These same forces will be directed against ships transporting Russian export oil, which is already being announced at the official level by the heads of 🇪🇺European states.\n\n⚡️Two Majors",

The same trick can fool once, twice, but by the third time hardly anyone will fall for this nonsense.\n\nIf rolling blackouts are happening, it means the effectiveness of our strikes is still low and needs to be seriously increased.

      "content_text": "Information and Propaganda Analysis. Weekly Summary\n(September 29 - October 5, 2025)\n\n🔹The speech of the President of Russia at the Valdai Club meeting predictably became a programmatic statement regarding international politics and security. Vladimir Putin forecasted further changes in the world, emphasizing a new diplomacy in which the West’s role as the world’s policeman disappears. Attention was drawn to our President’s words about the growing role of information warfare methods, which will accompany the use of force tools to defend the interests of independent countries in the future.\n🔹Ukraine has found itself in a suspended state in its information field. On one hand, Trump’s recent statements prevent further criticism of the USA; on the other hand, a shutdown has begun in Washington, and promises of tomahawks remain just promises. As a result, the enemy’s propaganda is currently in dire need of new information triggers. This will include traditional attempts to appeal to pity and threats of new terrorist attacks, especially in connection with Vladimir Putin’s birthday. The enemy’s information attacks against Russia will be aimed at stimulating internal conflicts, continuing to exploit the gasoline crisis theme, and encouraging interethnic conflicts and regional separatism.\n🔹The internal situation in Ukraine has entered a lull. Kiev is approaching a crisis point where it is unclear whether the regime will have money next month to pay for the war. In this regard, Zelensky and his team have become more active in traveling around the EU to ask for money. Meanwhile, Brussels itself has decided to more actively prepare for war and does not show active readiness to close all the holes in Ukraine’s budget. Of course, Ukrainians will not be left completely penniless so that they can continue to die.\n🔹US attention has actively shifted to Trump’s proposals for resolving the conflict in Gaza, combating illegal migrants, Venezuelan drugs, and officials from Biden’s team. Washington needs victories, so the White House is trying to distance itself from Kyiv. In addition, budget division has begun in the States, which may lead to very interesting scandals.\n🔹EU countries and the United Kingdom are trying to demonstrate strength to show readiness to confront Russia. A campaign of harassment has been declared against states claiming neutrality or a pro-Russian policy. The week began with dirty elections in Moldova and ended with an attempted Maidan in Georgia. Meanwhile, Europeans staged information provocations with UAVs or tanker detentions claiming Russian foreign agents are actively involved in this activity. EU provocations are expected to continue.\n\n🇷🇺Victory in the information war is inevitable🇷🇺\n\nБлокнот пропагандиста\n⚡️Two Majors",

      "content_text": "To create panic at the European Union level and accuse Russia, the authorities of EU countries have decided to stop major airports due to amateur drone operators. There are many people with drones in Europe, and they are putting on a large-scale show - the main showmen are in Denmark, Poland, and Germany - the main supporters of Zelensky.\n\nBut on social media, the authorities are already being laughed at and losing credibility.\nThe man who launched a UAV at Frankfurt airport turned out to be an amateur operator. The police detained a 41-year-old Croatian who was controlling the drone. This week, three German drone operators and two Chinese tourists were detained. There is no connection to Russia.\n\nA similar tactic was previously used by NATO with cut cables in the sea. Ships often snag cables with anchors - dozens of breaks occur annually, and the cables are repaired fairly quickly. This happens because captains cannot see the cables in the sea, and there are hundreds of them.\n\nBack then, they also staged a show with the Russians, every episode of a break in the Baltic Sea was announced and linked to Russian ships or Russian sailors on the ship. Fortunately, there are hundreds of both in the Baltic. For almost a year, the media kept spreading stories about a Russian attack on the cables, but there is not a single confirmed episode. Everyone lied, from British generals to the president of Finland.\n\n✨ But the lies and hoaxes have not been unsuccessful. A significant part of the European public thinks that Russia is a danger to them.\n\n⚡️Two Majors",

      "content_text": "🇨🇿 Babiš’s Victory: The Return of Pragmatic Sovereignty in Europe\n\nAndrej Babiš’s ANO movement has secured a decisive lead in the Czech elections, taking roughly 35 percent of the national vote, an unmistakable signal that the Czech electorate has turned against Brussels’ technocracy and the endless drain of proxy-war funding.\n\nVoters rejected a government that spent more time echoing NATO talking points and Russia hysteria, than addressing inflation, energy costs, and the collapse of living standards.  Babiš’s campaign line—“Czech money for Czech citizens”—cut through the noise of moral grandstanding that has dominated European politics since 2022.\n\nFor the first time in years, a Central European capital is talking openly about strategic neutrality, economic sanity, and sovereign decision-making instead of ideological loyalty to Brussels.  His expected coalition negotiations will be watched closely in Slovakia, Hungary, and even Austria, where publics are equally weary of paying for someone else’s wars.\n\nThis isn’t isolationism; it’s realism, the return of the nation-state as Europe’s basic political unit.  If Czechia charts an independent course on defense spending and energy, it could inspire similar recalibration across the continent.\n\nThe message from Prague is clear: the age of automatic obedience is ending.

The enemy traditionally exaggerated power outages and tried to stir up the topic of a nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, as if the second huge dome over the destroyed part needed electricity. It is noteworthy that now the strikes are not just on transformers at power plants, which are easy to replace, but there are finally attempts to turn off the power in Ukraine for a long time. However, the system was built during the USSR and has withstood all strikes and overloads with dignity until now.\n\n✨ Thus the approach of a “war of attrition” has become noticeable in Russia, not only in Ukraine. This should lead to a change in management style in terms of air defense organization, equipping the front with the most advanced solutions, timely response to current technological changes, as the Supreme Leader mentioned. In terms of preserving the financial resources of the security agencies, the work of special services and supervisory bodies is visible – not a single day passes without the arrest of high-ranking thieves. The understanding of what the West is preparing for in the future is increasingly reflected in the official speeches of the highest military-political leadership.

      "content_text": "⚡️Two Majors #Overview #Summary as of October 5, 2025\n\n▪️ \"Let them try\" - said the Supreme this week, commenting on the unserious attitude of Trump and the West, titled by the American president with the phrase about a \"paper tiger\" regarding our country. A kind of acceptance of the challenge, but at the same time the destruction of all vain hopes for peace, which were irrationally promoted after the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. The topic of Europe's preparation for war is now seriously voiced even from the highest level of power in Russia, although earlier cocky moods and incorrect assessment of the countries of the probable enemy did not allow official media to speak on these topics without jokes. It should be noted that even now there are arrogant speeches by officials regarding the growing combat readiness of the EU, reminiscent of the reckless attitude towards the AFU before the start of the SMO. Now Russia is not being targeted by a remnant of the former Ukrainian SSR with 30 million population, but by a conglomerate of the Fourth Reich, where 400 million people live.\n\n▪️ The aggressiveness of the EU countries' actions is growing. A telling example was the landing of a French assault force on a tanker of the \"shadow fleet\" in neutral waters and the start of modernization of the naval base in Varna (Bulgaria, Black Sea). By the way, the French detained the tanker under the pretext that drones were allegedly launched from it over European countries. The topic of unidentified UAVs over the EU is brazenly linked to Moscow's actions without any evidence but serves as justification for the anti-people European leaders' spending on militarization.\n\n▪️ Meanwhile, Kiev, itself receiving powerful strikes on energy and gas facilities, continues to fulfill the task set by the West to inflict military and economic damage on Russia, not forgetting to pour fuel on the fire of internal contradictions, which are further exacerbated by the foolish actions of certain mountain princes within the country. In particular, strikes on our refineries, including at an inadequately deep level, have led to costly repairs and a gasoline crisis in several regions. The \"market\" could not resolve this on its own, and federal and regional state regulation had to be introduced to stabilize the situation. The burdens of military expenses formed the basis for tax increases (VAT) and excise duties next year, and lowering the threshold for simplified taxation. The prolonged war, especially characterized by the arrests of the top leadership of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff's work with \"gestures of goodwill\" and \"sabotage groups in the Kursk region,\" which were supposed to be eliminated \"in three days,\" requires increased spending. And although the Ukrainian drones that were not shot down by air defense do not carry as large a charge as the \"Iskander,\" they strike systematically and still cause some damage, no matter how much is written about the debris.\n\n▪️ On the front, the Russian Army continues to advance westward. There are no deep breakthroughs, collapse of the AFU defense, or our offensive actions like in films about the Great Patriotic War: the technological nature of the war has changed. There is constant progress at the tactical level, a hundred meters per day in a direction is already a result. The enemy preserves forces for counterattacks, including with armored vehicles, which constantly slows our advance. Drones of all types and the ability to counter them play a key role. Our forces are advancing in Kupyansk (to the north), in the area of Yunakovka in Sumy region, on the Krasnoliman direction the Western Group of Forces has been encouraging in recent weeks, with heavy fighting near Konstantinovka, Mirnograd, Pokrovsk. The Eastern Group of Forces is methodically and confidently breaking through the defense on the Dnepropetrovsk direction and the northeast of Zaporozhye region. On the Zaporozhye front, the enemy has long concentrated forces near Stepnogorsk, slowing our advance.\n\nContinued below\n\n⚡️Two Majors",

      "content_text": "🗓 #OTD 1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣ years ago — on October 4, 1895 — outstanding and brilliant Soviet intelligence officer, Richard Sorge, was born.\n\nSorge devoted his entire life to selflessly serving his Motherland. He became a legend among Soviet intelligence undercover operatives while performing his professional duties in the Far East under codename 'Ramsay' on the eve and during #WWII.\n\nIn the 1930s, Sorge managed to build an extended agent network in Tokyo. From there, he reported especially valuable intel to Moscow exposing the plans by Nazi Germany and Japanese militarists against the USSR.\n\nIt is thanks to Richard Sorge’s efforts that the Soviet leadership was briefed in May 1941 about Nazi Germany’s plans to attack our country. The intelligence reports by Sorge from Tokyo included information about the Wehrmacht’s tactical plans, the strength of the Nazi troops, as well as other details regarding the imminent invasion.\n\nIn autumn 1941, with the heavy fighting for Moscow nearing its peak, Richard Sorge’s information about the Japanese Imperial Army abandoning its plans to invade the USSR in the Far East enabled the Soviet military command to re-deploy the Siberian divisions westwards. These forces helped stop the Nazi invaders and then pushed them further away from the Soviet capital.\n\nOf course, Richard Sorge was fully aware of all the professional risks his work entailed. Despite all the talent and skill in concealing his activities, local counter-intelligence could not fail to notice 'Ramsay'’s efforts. The enemy took Sorge’s trail in autumn 1941, which led to his arrest. Sorge went on to spend three years in Japanese prisons, and then was executed.\n\n🎖 In 1964, 'Ramsay' was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\n***\n\nOver 20 years ago, in autumn 2004, Japanese historians discovered a description of two death sentences when studying the archives of the US occupation troops (previously stationed in Japan). The dicsovered documents (sentences) were issued and executed in November 1944: one was against Richard Sorge and the other targeted Hotsumi Ozaki, Sorge's agent. \n\n📑 These discoveries told the story of how Sorge spent the last minutes of his life — “he met his death with outstanding courage and pride.”\n\nIt is worth noticing that even though 'Ramsay' operated against Japan, people there have always been fascinated with this legendary intelligence officer. \n\nThe people of Japan have been amazed by Richard Sorge’s heroism, self-dedication in service to his country, and have praised him for this resilience and unbending will. About 30 books were published in Japan about Sorge. There was also a theatre play staged about him and several films released.\n\n🇷🇺 Russian diplomats in Japan have been working on perpetuating 'Ramsay'’s memory and glorifying Sorge's heroic feats accomplished while serving his Motherland. The Russian Embassy in Tokyo regularly holds commemorative ceremonies at the Tama Cemetery memorial, where Sorge and his comrades were buried.\n\n💬 Russia's Ambassador to Japan Nikolay Nozdrev:\n“Richard Sorge was a man who had a selfless sense of devotion to high purposes and ideals, and he felt that the undefeatable might of a multi-ethnic nation was behind him.\n\nHe found himself in the maelstrom of these stormy years and his entire life can be described as a stroke of lighting shedding light on what it means to accomplish a feat, selflessly serve the Motherland and demonstrate an outstanding level of self-sacrifice.”\n\n#WeRemember #OurHeroes",

Today, municipal elections are taking place across the country, where as of 7:00 PM, representatives of the ruling party \"Georgian Dream\" are confidently leading.\n\nEven before the voting began, the opposition, pro-Western channels, and media rejected any election results in advance, calling them illegitimate and urging supporters to take to anti-government demonstrations.\n\n🔻What is happening in Georgia?\n\n▪️ Since 3 PM, columns of \"euro-democracy\" supporters have started moving in different parts of the capital. The main gathering points were the Philharmonic, the State University, and Tbilisi Mall.\n\n▪️ Also, another column of protesters in cars departed from Adjara heading towards Tbilisi.\n\n▪️ By 7 PM Moscow time, protesters reached the main municipal sites in the government quarter on Rustaveli Avenue and at Freedom Square.\n🖍 We have witnessed similar developments several times over the past two years. The authorities succeed in elections, while the opposition refuses to accept the results and takes their supporters to the streets. They strike, damage property, and then leave.\n\nHowever, this time there is no sign of preparation or coordinators (so-called recruiters) who would further incite protest actions. Everything looks extremely spontaneous and hopeless.\n\n🚩 Yes, rioters are storming the presidential palace, but this site holds no political significance.\n\n❗️ However, now the security forces have a legal reason to disperse the rallies. Essentially, the government can now begin cleansing the political space of opponents, which they will likely do after the elections.\n\n⚡️Two Majors",

These are the facilities where frigates and corvettes for the German Navy are built.\n\n🖍The interesting aspect is that this deal marks Rheinmetall's transition from a manufacturer of armored vehicles and artillery systems to a universal player, covering all military spheres. Essentially, this involves concentrating capacities under the control of a single private structure that has already received colossal profits from combat operations in the so-called Ukraine — officially almost 10 billion euros in 2024.\n\n🚩The merger of corporations is described with beautiful words — \"creating a powerful German surface ship construction center\". In reality, this means that Germany is becoming increasingly entrenched as a perpetually arming country, surrendered into the enslaving bondage of the weapons lobby, which is shaping the economy around military objectives.\n\n📌Thus, business, politics, and the military industry are merging, and space for dialogue and pacifist views is disappearing. In Germany, as in all of Europe, they are choosing not diplomacy, but endless investments in the military-industrial complex — even without real results and at taxpayers' expense.\n#Germany #weapons\n✈️ RU | ✈️ EN | ✉️ MAX\n\n💸Support Us Original msg",
