There are growing signs that the US and Israel are setting the groundwork for a new massive attack on Iran.\n\nTHE BUILD-UP IS UNMISTAKABLE:\n\n🔸Tanker Deployment: Dozens of US KC-135 & KC-46 refueling tankers are now in Qatar. These are not defensive assets; they are the lifeline for long-range strike operations.\n\n🔸Carrier Strike Group: The USS Gerald R. Ford is positioned in the Mediterranean, a classic pre-escalation move.\n\n🔸Legal Pretext: New executive orders are effectively internationalizing potential conflict zones, setting the stage for a wider war.\n\n🔸Regional Betrayal: Key nations are falling in line, isolating Iran economically and politically.\n\nThe pattern is identical to the run-ups in Iraq and Libya. But Iran is a different beast entirely.\n\nIRAN'S ASYMMETRIC TRUMP CARD:\n\nIran doesn’t have to win outright. If Iran succeeds in imposing an unacceptably high price on its enemies, that could be enough to squeak out a bloody victory. \n\nThe Strait of Hormuz—a 21-mile wide chokepoint for 20% of the world's oil—is their lever.

      "content_text": "🤡 📱 Bezos claims AI is ‘good’ kind of bubble as market storm clouds gather\n\n🗣 Unlike a banking crisis, which threatens a system-wide crash, other kinds of bubbles “are not nearly as bad, and can even be good,” because society still “benefits from those inventions,” the billionaire said at a tech conference in Turin on Friday.\n\nBezos’ comments come amid a stream of warning signs that the AI-fueled tech boom could soon come crashing down as tech company debt, described as “the canary in the coal mine for market bubbles,” piles up.\n\nMeta alone recently asked for $29B in private capital for its AI data centers, while Oracle says it needs $18B for its AI infrastructure.\n\n💬 “I wouldn’t touch this stuff now,” TS Lombard global macro managing director Dario Perkins told Axios. \n\nAccording to the analyst, “we’re much closer to 2000 than 1995” in the parallel to the dotcom bubble, which wiped $1.75 trillion from the markets, and set the stage for the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\n👉 Bezos’ view on AI’s “benefits” isn’t universal, either. Last week, a pair of Berkley scientists with 25 years’ experience studying AI said the technology could wipe out humanity, and warned nations to be ready to bomb data centers to stop an AI superintelligence.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

      "content_text": "🇬🇧😈 Tony Blair: From Kosovo and Iraq lies to possible Epstein ties\n\nDonald Trump plans to appoint former British Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair to a new board overseeing post-war Gaza. Here’s why it’s a bad idea.\n\n♦️ Bombing of Yugoslavia\n\n⚫️ Blair was NATO’s most hawkish voice on the 1999 Yugoslav war, pushing for a ground invasion alongside the bombing campaign\n\n⚫️ His government justified the bombing by claims of ‘genocide’ of up to 100,000 Albanians in Kosovo — but investigators counted 2,108 deaths in 1999, and in 2001 the UN-supervised Supreme Court in Pristina ruled Serbian troops did not commit genocide\n\n⚫️ Researcher Mark Curtis revealed MI6 and the CIA armed and trained Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo from 1996, while Albanian leader Hashim Thaci, indicted for war crimes in 2020, was Blair’s ally\n\n♦️ Iraq War\n\n⚫️ Blair strongly backed the 2003 US-led invasion, claiming Iraq had chemical weapons — which were never found. E vidence shows Blair knew that was untrue.\n\n⚫️ A 2002 Downing Street memo said “military action was now seen as inevitable” while conceding the chemical weapons case was “thin”\n\n⚫️ Blair's adviser Jonathan Powell urged intelligence to “redraft” the dossier to make the Iraqi threat seem imminent\n\n⚫️ The UK’s 2016 Iraq Inquiry concluded the invasion went ahead before diplomatic options were exhausted, intelligence was murky and Iraq posed no urgent threat\n\n♦️ Mass surveillance\n\n⚫️ Blair has championed mass surveillance and digital ID since the early 2000s\n\n⚫️ At the 2020 World Economic Forum Cyber Polygon, and again in 2025, Blair promoted digital ID, aligning with Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who has donated over £257m to the Tony Blair Institute since 2021\n\n♦️ Ties to Jeffrey Epstein?\n\n⚫️ Blair's adviser Peter Mandelson continued his friendship with Epstein in the 2000s, offering help even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction\n\n⚫️ The Times reported Mandelson urged Blair to meet Epstein in a 2002 memo — which current Labour PM Keir Starmer’s government has kept under wraps, allegedly to avoid embarrassment\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

It includes a ceasefire, exchange of Israeli hostages in return for Palestinians taken by the Jewish state, and stipulates Hamas giving up control over Gaza.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

The US, meanwhile, is pressuring Iraq to disarm the militias – despite their critical role in crushing ISIS and stabilizing the country between 2015-2017.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

They’ve also had a serious impact on household consumption, with mayors from Lutsk to Ivano-Frankovsk urging residents to prepare for sustained blackouts.\n\n📈 European media estimate Russian drone and missile strikes increased 36% in September to 5,600+ drones and ~185 missiles.\n\nMilitary expert and retired military pilot Vladimir Popov says while Russia largely avoided sustained attacks on Ukraine’s power grid up to now for humanitarian reasons, escalating Ukrainian threats are grounds for retaliation.\n\n💬 “This winter will be a test for the Kiev regime – heat and electricity will be increasingly scarce,” Popov predicts.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",
