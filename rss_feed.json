      "content_text": "🐄British farmer’s bone-chilling warning: Starmer and Gates plan 50% cut in farm animals by 2050?\n\nPro Farmers United organizer Tim Taylor claims he has seen a document highlighting insidious plans by the government and powerful global business interests to squeeze Britain’s farmers into a 50-100% reduction in farm animal allowances in 25 years’ time.\n\n🗣“Guess who has signed up to that: yes, the two biggest ***holes in the world: Starmer and Bill Gates…So it looks like their little world takeover is coming along nicely for them, but unfortunately, we’ve now got the document,” Taylor said.\n\n👉While the nature of his info remains unclear, UK and European climate initiatives’ objectives are often hidden in plain sight. For instance, the Climate Change Committee recommends a 20% drop in meat and dairy consumption by 2030, and a 38% cut in livestock by 2050 to achieve so-called “net-zero emissions.”\n\n📌Britain is one of scores of countries where farmers are sounding the alarm about globalist plans for food – from reductions in meat production to the monopolization of farmland, leaving millions starving. Or perhaps that’s the whole point?\n\n👍  Boost us | Chat | @geopolitics_prime",

Brian Mast (R-Fla.), Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, directed Republican staff to replace \"West Bank\" with \"Judea and Samaria\" in all official communications.\n\n➡️ As for Israel, the Knesset recently voted to \"extend sovereignty\" over the West Bank.\n\n➡️ The majority backed applying Israeli law to the West Bank, the Jordan Valley, and all of what they call the “historic homeland of the Jewish people,” urging the government to make it official.

      "content_text": "🚨💰🇺🇸US Dollar SCAM: Printing trillions & spreading INFLATION worldwide\n\nSince 1971, when the US 37th president Richard Nixon ended the dollar’s gold backing, the US has been free to print trillions of dollars out of thin air.\n\n🤔 HOW IT WORKS:\n\n▪️Before 1971, $1 was tied to 1/35 oz of gold — a fixed value. After that, the dollar became fiat, backed only by the Federal Reserve (Fed) printing power.\n\n▪️The Fed doesn’t just print cash — it now creates digital dollars by buying govt bonds.\n\n▪️From 2020 to 2022, the money supply (M2) surged 40%, adding nearly $10 trillion. By mid-2025, M2 reached $22 trillion — steadily eroding the value of your money.\n\n🫣 SEIGNIORAGE — HIDDEN THEFT:\n\n▪️Printing $100 costs just 12 cents — that difference, called seigniorage, nets the U.S. $50–100 billion every year.\n\n▪️Worldwide, this hidden scam siphons off a staggering $804 billion annually from the global economy.\n\n📈 INFLATION? ENGINEERED DEPRECIATION\n\n▪️Most dollars today were created post-2020, with no increase in goods. This drives inflation — your savings buy less.\n\n▪️For example, $100K in 2019 is worth roughly $65K in 2025 due to inflation fuelled by excessive dollar printing.\n\n📊 US TRADE DEFICIT:\n\n▪️The US has imported over $15 trillion in real goods from the world since 1971 — oil, electronics, food.\n\n▪️In return it exports worthless paper dollars printed endlessly, saddling other countries with inflation and debt.\n\n🌐 GLOBAL IMPACT:\n\n▪️Dollar strength crushes emerging markets. Turkey’s lira collapse and 80% inflation in 2022 is just one example.\n\n▪️Other nations face inflation spikes, debt, and poverty due to dollar 'dominance'.\n\n🌀 ILLUSION OF US STABILITY\n\nUS govt debt keeps rising, but dollar still rules:\n\n▪️USD is involved in 88% of global foreign exchange trades\n▪️ Holds 57.8% of global reserves (IMF data)\n▪️ $6.63 trillion in foreign dollar reserves\n\nDollar lets US print, borrow, and spend like no other — while the rest of the world bears the hidden cost. 😠\n\nChat | GG on Instagram | GG Movies Channel",
