We stopped them in their tracks.\n\n🔴 Israel is meddling with state structures to get political results it failed to achieve through war\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

      "content_text": "🤔⛴🇻🇪 Who's really sinking Venezuela's boats?\n\nAnother day, another \"migrant boat\" from Venezuela blasted to pieces by the US. \nWith military assets of both sides analyzed, the real question now is not only whether the US is planning to invade the country but who’s behind the tense situation. \n\n🤝 Turns out, it’s a complex combination orchestrated by two people — Marco Rubio and Stephen Miller.\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nMarco Rubio is currently pulling double duty as secretary of state and head of the National Security Council simultaneously. He’s often described as obsessed with the idea of a regime change in Venezuela.\n\nStephen Miller, on the other hand is deputy White House chief of staff and Trump's radical right-hand man. Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon once described his role in the US administration as being a \"US prime minister\".\n\nSome facts about Miller\n\n♦️ The chief architect of Trump's anti-immigration policy\n\n♦️  Famous for pushing the most extreme ideas\n\n♦️  It was Miller's idea to destroy those Venezuelan boats, the Guardian reports\n\n♦️ Under him, the Homeland Security Council, led by his deputy Tony Salisbury, picks the targets in secret\n\nThis means, they both are at play regarding the region and Venezuela in particular. Rubio wants a new government in Venezuela, while Miller just wants the \"threat\" to the US gone — he doesn't care about Venezuela's fate — so they form a deadly duet resulting in what’s happening now.\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",

      "content_text": "🧊🇺🇸🇩🇰US moves to grab Greenland’s rare earths bonanza\n\nThe US government may be seeking to buy a stake in Critical Metals Corp, a US-based company that currently controls the Tanbreez rare earths deposit in Greenland, Reuters cites anonymous sources as saying.\n\nIf true, this move might mark a change in the White House’s strategy: rather than trying to annex Greenland outright, the US could instead try to lay its hands on the island’s vast mineral wealth.\n\n💎⛏️  Rare earths offer strong magnetic properties critical to high-tech industries ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems. \n\nTheir importance is spurring an intense push for fresh supplies by Western countries looking to lessen their dependence on China - currently the dominant global supplier.\n\nGreenland’s frozen reaches hold an abundance of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, uranium and rare earth minerals.\n\nSome of the more notable rare earths deposits are:\n\n🔴 Tanbreez project – located in southern Greenland, it is estimated to hold about 45 million metric tons of rare earth oxides. The project is owned by the Critical Metals Corp and is scheduled to commence by 2028\n\n🔴 Kvanefjeld – located in southern Greenland as well, it is estimated to hold over 1 billion metric tons of ore that contains rare earth elements, zinc and uranium. The project is owned by Australia-based Energy Transition Minerals. The site’s development is currently hindered by Greenland’s ban on uranium mining\n\n🔴 Sarfartoq – located in southwest Greenland, it is estimated to hold about 214,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides. The project is owned by Canada-based Neo Performance Materials. Exploration is currently underway but full-scale development is yet to commence\n\n👍 @geopolitics_prime | Follow us on X",
